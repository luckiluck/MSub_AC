2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,160
心地いい

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,980
What a pleasant feeling.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,900
待ちわびた王はついに現れた

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,070
The king I've been waiting for has finally appeared.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,070
神話の時代より受け継がれた我が一族の悲願

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,030
My clan's greatest wish has been passed down since the age of legends.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,540
To the people I left behind
in the White Dragon's village...

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,540
白龍の里に残してきた者達よ

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,290
I promise I will protect the king.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,300
私は必ずや王をお守りしてみせる

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,900
白蛇様

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,210
White Snake.

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,840
You must be exhausted.
You haven't been on the road before.

15
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,120
お疲れでしょう 慣れない旅は

16
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,760
もう一度白蛇と呼べば その喉掻き切るぞ

17
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,590
Call me "White Snake" again,
and I'll tear out your throat.

18
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,140
此れしきで疲れるか

19
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,680
This isn't enough to exhaust me.

20
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,810
Well, I thought you must be
missing your village by now.

21
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,140
いや そろそろ里が恋しくなった頃かなぁと

22
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,230
What are you talking about?

23
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,370
何を言う 姫様が私を望まれたのだ

24
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,270
The princess asked for my assistance.

25
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,380
もしもの時は其方を守れとな

26
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,400
She said to protect you if something happens.

27
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,290
箱入り坊ちゃんが戦えますかね

28
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,070
Does a sheltered boy like you know how to fight?

29
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,590
静まれ

30
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,490
That's enough!

31
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,740
We're going to be traveling together,
so don't fight.

32
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,250
これから一緒に旅するんだから揉めないの

33
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,120
申し訳ありません 姫様

34
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,740
I'm sorry, Princess.

35
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,790
Hak, Ki-ja is anxious about leaving his village for the first time.

36
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,490
ハク キジャは初めて外に出て
不安でいっぱいなんだから 虐めない

37
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,710
Don't tease him!

38
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,960
私はそんな...

39
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,870
I'm not...

40
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,170
Ki-ja, teasing people is Hak's hobby.
Don't let it get to you.

41
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,120
キジャ ハクの虐めっ子は趣味だから 気にしない

42
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,450
趣味

43
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,300
My hobby?

44
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,550
Let's get going!

45
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,780
そろそろ行きますよ

46
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,320
はい

47
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,130
Okay!

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,190
Episode 11:   The Dragon's Claw

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,190
Episode 11:   The Dragon's Claw

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,100
キジャ 他の龍の気配が分かるんだよね

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,280
Ki-ja, you can sense the other dragons, right?

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,920
ユンと言ったな もちろんだ

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Your name is Yun, isn't it?
Of course I can.

54
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,920
心の目を研ぎ澄ますと 存在を感じることが出来る

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,830
By sharpening my mind's eye,
I can feel their presence.

56
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,790
Then tell us which one is closest.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,360
じゃ 一番近い奴を教えて

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,580
やって見よう

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,660
I'll try.

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,400
もっとも近く感じるのは 恐らく青龍

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,260
I believe the closest one is the Blue Dragon.

62
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,700
誰が居るとか分かるんだ

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,260
You even know who it is?

64
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,830
どこ

65
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,600
Where is he?

66
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,540
そうだな

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,430
Well...

68
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,250
向こうが何がもやっとする

69
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,270
I feel something coming from roughly over there.

70
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,430
場所は見事に大雑把だね

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,480
Well, that's rather vague.

72
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,870
案ずるな

73
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Don't worry.

74
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,830
皆 私の後をついてまいれ

75
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,780
Follow me, everyone.

76
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,900
I will worry!

77
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,850
案ずるよ

78
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,380
生まれて初めて外出た奴についていくのは案ずるよ

79
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,860
I'm worried about following someone who's never left his village before!

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,280
This may be my first time outside, but I know about the world.

81
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,210
外に出ずとも外の事くらい知っている

82
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,910
我が一族は各地に飛んで情報を集めていたのだから

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,000
My clan has visited various regions and gathered information-

84
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,750
Ki-ja!

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
キジャ

86
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,850
なななな なんだこのもの達は

87
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,800
Wh-What are these?

88
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,090
Who gave them permission
to make their home here?

89
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,100
誰の許しを得てこんな所に居を構えているのだ

90
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,720
W-Wait. Stop.

91
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,850
ま 待って 止せ

92
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,970
No more!

93
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,920
それ以上は

94
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,600
No! Stop!

95
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:14,750
いやめて 来ないで

96
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,900
白龍様は最後尾をのそっとついてきな

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,940
Stay back!

98
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,940
You can follow behind us, White Dragon.

99
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,570
I can still feel them crawling all over me.

100
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,850
まだ這いずり回られた感触が残っている

101
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,560
龍神様は虫より弱いんですね

102
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,570
I see that dragons are weaker than insects.

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,130
ち 違う 私はわさわさ もさもさ にゅるにゅるした物が嫌いなだけだ

104
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,830
N-No! I just dislike creepy crawly creatures!

105
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,870
我が力は誇り高き 白き龍より賜りし神の力

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,910
I have been granted the proud, divine strength of the White Dragon.

107
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,830
常人のものと思うな

108
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,420
I'm not like ordinary men.

109
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,590
そこにもげじげじ

110
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,500
Look. More bugs.

111
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,830
ま なんでもいいさ

112
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,470
Well, whatever. I'm not expecting anything from your dusty old power.

113
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,580
埃かぶった古の力なんぞ 充てにしてねぇんで

114
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,550
What?! Want to test it right here, then?

115
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,630
なに ならばこの場で試してみるか

116
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,600
Oh?

117
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,920
姫さん 隠れて

118
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,890
Princess, hide.

119
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,600
Hak?

120
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,050
ハク

121
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,050
どうしたの キジャ

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,060
What's wrong, Ki-ja?

123
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,320
誰か来る

124
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,230
Someone's coming.

125
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,400
Someone? Who?

126
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,850
誰かって誰さ

127
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,030
しかも結構な数だ

128
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,650
There are quite a few of them.

129
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,650
Their footsteps sound unrefined.

130
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,630
あまり品のいい足音ではないな

131
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,520
やばいよ ここ火の土地のご近所さんなんだから

132
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,530
This is bad! We're near the Fire Tribe's territory.

133
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,160
火の部族は敵か

134
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,780
Is the Fire Tribe our enemy?

135
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,580
ま ほぼ敵だな

136
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,450
Yeah, basically.

137
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,180
はい ハク 弓を使っていい

138
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,410
Hey! Hak, can I use my bow?

139
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,330
先生は許しません 隠れてなさい

140
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,540
I won't allow it. Go hide.

141
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,880
Let's go.

142
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,140
ほら 行くよ

143
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,680
Well, who would've thought
we'd find prey out here?

144
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,690
おい こんな所に獲物が居たぞ

145
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,470
They don't look like they have much.

146
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,980
なんだよ 大したもんは持ってなさそうだな

147
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,920
なんだ山賊か

148
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,890
Oh, they're just bandits.

149
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,140
What does that mean?

150
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,430
なんだとはなんだ

151
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,160
そうでもねぇぜ あっちに女が二人

152
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,810
No, look. There are two women over there.

153
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,900
美少年だよ

154
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,570
I'm a handsome young man.

155
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,960
この兄ちゃんなんか良い身なりだし
売れそうな面してやがる

156
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,740
This boy's wearing some nice clothes.

157
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,860
I bet we could sell him too.

158
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
おい とりあえず刻んで構わんのだろう

159
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,320
Hey, it's all right if I tear them apart, isn't it?

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,800
隠れてても構わんよ

161
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,700
Or you can hide, if you want.

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,450
誰が

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,080
Who would hide?

164
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,830
なんだ 兄ちゃん 震えてんのか

165
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,830
What's wrong, boy? Are you trembling?

166
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,290
心配すんなって大人しくしてりゃ殺したりしねぇから

167
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,300
Don't worry. If you behave, we won't kill y-

168
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,320
おい どうした

169
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,210
What happened?

170
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,840
I-I don't know, but his arm is boiling hot!

171
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,870
分かんねけど こいつの手 沸騰してるみてぇに熱い

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,970
Huh? Don't be stupid.

173
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,960
なにバカ言って

174
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,830
不用意に触れぬ方が良いぞ

175
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,730
You should be careful what you touch.

176
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,070
数千年

177
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,280
This power has waited thousands of years to protect its master.

178
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,900
主を守る為に待ち続けたこの力 私でさえ抑えが効かぬ

179
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,360
Not even I can restrain it.

180
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,700
Huh?

181
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,740
What is that?

182
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,130
なんだ あの腕

183
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,780
His arm!

184
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,300
待たせたな 白き龍の腕

185
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,990
Sorry to have kept you waiting,
arm of the White Dragon!

186
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,710
H-He's a monster!

187
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,350
化け物だ

188
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,350
あれが龍の爪の力

189
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,760
So that's the power of the dragon's claw.

190
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,690
顔に似合わず えぐいね

191
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,430
You're more heartless than you look.

192
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,310
まだ まだ足りぬ

193
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,310
This still isn't enough.

194
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,160
それでハクとやら 姫様のご命令通り 其方も守ろうか

195
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,060
Hak, was it? Should I also protect you,
as the Princess instructed?

196
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,740
お構いなく

197
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,940
Don't worry about me.

198
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,370
間に合ってるんで

199
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,570
I can handle myself.

200
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,860
Don't mess with us!

201
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,590
ふざけるな てめら

202
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,510
な なんだ此奴 普通じゃねぇ

203
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,290
Wh-Who are these guys?
They're not normal!

204
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,620
How rude.

205
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,440
失敬よな 普通じゃねぇのは そっちの白蛇だけだろ

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,300
The White Snake is the only one
who isn't normal!

207
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,240
どこ狙ってますか 白蛇様

208
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,680
Where are you aiming that thing, White Snake?

209
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,600
I told you I'd tear your throat out
if you called me "White Snake" again.

210
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,810
もう一度白蛇と呼べば喉を掻き切ると言ったはずだ

211
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,820
気にすんなよ 趣味なんだから

212
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,720
Don't let it get to you.
It's just my hobby.

213
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,700
しかしそれ ちょっと興奮しるぎじゃねぇの 目立ち過ぎ

214
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,480
Anyway, aren't you getting a bit too excited?
You're attracting too much attention.

215
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,520
姫をお守りするのが至上の喜び そなたこそ その大刀邪魔だ

216
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,440
Nothing delights me more
than protecting the princess.

217
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,570
It's your blade that's getting in my way!

218
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,960
四龍ってのは一途だね

219
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,620
You dragons certainly are devoted, aren't you?

220
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,200
Why do you protect the princess, then?

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,700
では其方は何のために姫を守るのだ

222
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,630
会ったばっかの他人に放すか バカ

223
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,670
I'm not telling someone I just met, idiot.

224
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,130
I-Idiot?

225
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,120
バ バカだと

226
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,300
行くぜ

227
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,130
Let's go.

228
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,340
I thought he was a helpless human,
but he's incredibly strong.

229
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,340
こやつ 非力な人間と思っていたが なんと言う力

230
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,810
I hate to admit it, but he may be
as strong as the dragon's arm.

231
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,980
認めたくはないが 龍の腕と互角に近い威力では

232
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,640
They're strange. They're definitely strange!

233
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,630
彼奴等変 絶対変

234
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,140
キジャはこの世の者とは思えないし

235
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,020
It's as if Ki-ja isn't of this world,

236
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,020
and the Thunder Beast's speed isn't even human.

237
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,120
雷獣も人間技じゃないよ あの速さ

238
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,990
Do you want to be useful?

239
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,140
役に立ちたい

240
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,990
Hak told me not to do it.

241
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,790
ハクがダメって言ったもの

242
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,470
我慢

243
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,610
I'm restraining myself.

244
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,230
でもこう言う時の為に練習したんでしょう

245
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,950
But didn't you practice for a time like this?

246
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,160
俺の計算によれば

247
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,170
According to my calculations,

248
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,350
今のあんたの飛距離ならあそこ
雷獣を後ろから狙ってる奴

249
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,250
that guy coming up behind the Thunder Beast should be within your range.

250
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,760
もう少し上に向けて

251
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,760
Aim a little higher.

252
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,140
今だ

253
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,670
Now!

254
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,100
やった

255
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,050
All right!

256
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,010
Yun, that was amazing!
You're a better teacher than Hak!

257
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,960
ユン凄い ハクより教え方上手

258
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,300
人のだと分かるんだよな 自分だとうまく当たらない

259
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,270
It's easy to help others.

260
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,980
I can hardly hit anything myself.

261
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,020
大人しくしてな 嬢ちゃん達

262
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,860
Stay still, girls.

263
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,580
人質になって貰うぞ

264
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,070
You're going to be my hostages.

265
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,230
姫さん無事か

266
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,240
Princess, are you all right?

267
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,360
ありがとう

268
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,370
Thank you.

269
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,550
面倒くさい

270
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,450
What a pain.

271
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,030
もう 終わったの

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,170
It is over already?

273
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,700
其方何人倒した

274
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,710
How many did you defeat?

275
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,590
Huh? I don't remember.

276
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,920
覚えてね

277
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,800
I defeated twenty-eight.

278
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,830
私は28だ

279
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,090
Then I defeated forty.

280
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,140
じゃ 俺40

281
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,180
Liar! You said you didn't remember!

282
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,360
嘘をつけ

283
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,520
覚えてないと言ったではないか 大体そんな人数いなかっ...

284
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,800
Besides, there weren't even that many-

285
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,360
キジャ 大丈夫

286
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,390
Ki-ja! Are you all right?

287
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,610
Yes. I fought a little too hard.

288
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,030
はい 少々暴れ過ぎました

289
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,920
もっと洗練された闘いをお見せするはずだったのに

290
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,530
I meant to fight more elegantly.

291
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,540
Actually, I like that the white dragon god has such a bloodthirsty fighting style.

292
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,030
いや 俺はいいと思うぜ

293
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,850
白き龍神様のその血生臭い闘いっぷり

294
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,660
I'm thrilled.

295
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,670
嬉しいね

296
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,920
At the castle, no one could keep up with me.

297
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,020
城に居た頃は本気で俺についてくれる奴は居なかった

298
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,460
Someday, I hope we can fight-

299
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,560
一度手合せ...ねぇか

300
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,360
ハク

301
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,630
Hak!

302
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,960
死んだか

303
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,920
Did he die?

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,130
He isn't dead!

305
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,230
死んでない

306
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,140
You idiot. You opened your wound.

307
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,520
バカ 傷開いちゃってるよ

308
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,390
His injury hasn't healed yet.

309
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,850
本当は傷治ってないんだよ

310
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,920
しれっとしてるけど ボロボロなんだから

311
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,140
He acts like he's okay, but he's still a mess.

312
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,430
こんな体であんな動きを

313
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
He moved so quickly, with those injuries?

314
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,540
信じられんこの男 化け物か

315
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,400
This man is unbelievable.

316
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,650
Is he a monster?

317
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,000
あんたに言われたくないと思うよ

318
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,900
He probably wouldn't want to hear that from you.

319
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,320
日が傾いてきたね

320
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,820
The sun is setting.

321
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,580
何処か寝る場所探さないと

322
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,580
We should find somewhere to sleep.

323
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,330
Is there an inn around here?

324
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,430
この辺に宿があるのか

325
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,070
野宿だよ

326
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,000
Under the stars.

327
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,040
Under the stars?

328
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,140
野宿

329
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,700
これだからぼんぼんわ

330
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,880
This is why I can't stand rich kids.

331
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,750
白龍様は最後尾をてれっとついてきな

332
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,670
Just follow behind us, White Dragon.

333
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,830
って何してんのお姫様

334
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,550
What are you doing, Princess?!

335
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,650
だってハク動けないのよ 運ばないと

336
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,550
Hak can't move. We have to carry him.

337
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,340
キジャ凄い

338
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,390
Ki-ja, that's amazing!

339
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,470
龍の腕は常人の何十倍もの力がありますので

340
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,140
The dragon's arm is ten times stronger than an ordinary person's.

341
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,980
Uh, it's just my right arm, actually.

342
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,080
いえ 右手だけなんですけど

343
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,700
大丈夫ですよ この者は

344
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,320
He'll be all right.

345
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,530
Huh?

346
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,890
えん ハクは強いもの

347
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,790
Yeah. Hak is strong.

348
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,980
だから 今は守られてばはりだけど 何時かは私が守りたい

349
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,880
He protects me all the time now,
but someday, I want to protect him.

350
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,550
You are strong, despite living
in the castle your whole life.

351
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,470
姫はずっと城におられたのに お強いですね

352
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,140
強くなんかないわ

353
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,210
I'm not strong.

354
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,450
しかし 山賊にもあまり動じておられなかった

355
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,510
But you weren't disturbed by the bandits.

356
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
そうね

357
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,600
You're right. I'm not afraid of bandits.

358
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,990
山賊は怖くない あの夜以上に怖いことは 私にはないの

359
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,890
Nothing could terrify me more than that night.

360
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,400
Hey!

361
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,120
早く

362
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,020
Hurry up!

363
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,500
行こう

364
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,530
Let's go.

365
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,990
Perhaps it's because of the White Dragon's blood that I was granted to protect King Hiryuu,

366
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,920
これは 緋龍王を守る為
与えられた白龍の血のせいだろうか

367
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,700
支えて差し上げたい

368
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,580
but I wish to guard the back of this frail girl,

369
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,960
強くあろうとする 泣きだしそうな か弱い背中を

370
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,880
who tries to be strong even though
she's on the verge of tears.

371
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,870
これはなんだ

372
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,550
What is this?

373
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,250
夕食ですけど 何か

374
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,010
It's dinner. Is there a problem?

375
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,250
夕食 これはさっき山道に生えていた まさかの雑草ではないか

376
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,260
Dinner? These are weeds that were growing on the mountain path!

377
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,980
雑草じゃないよ ちゃんと食べられる山菜だから

378
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,680
They aren't weeds!

379
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,060
They're mountain vegetables you can eat.

380
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,560
虫を入れなかっただけありがたく思えな

381
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,310
You should be grateful I didn't add any insects.

382
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,400
Insects? You eat insects?

383
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,520
虫 其方虫を食すのか

384
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,380
虫は栄養あるの

385
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,270
Insects are nutritious.

386
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,530
Are you all right with this food, Princess?

387
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,320
姫様は平気なのですか この様な食事

388
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,540
虫はまだ食べられないけど だいぶ慣れたわ

389
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,070
I still can't eat bugs,
but I've gotten used to most of it.

390
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,380
だって私...

391
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,030
After all...

392
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,510
嫌がってる暇なんてなかったし

393
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,410
I've had bigger fish to fry.

394
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,630
But since Yun arrived, the food has gotten better!

395
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,730
でもユンが来てから かなり食事が美味しくなったんだから

396
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,630
Twitch.

397
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,900
ハクと二人の時はもう酷くて

398
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,380
When it was just Hak and me, it was awful.

399
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,300
あら どうして泣いてるの

400
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,460
Huh? Why are you crying?

401
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,050
Princess, your journey has been so harsh.

402
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,230
姫様 よほど過酷な旅を

403
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,140
What was that about my cooking?

404
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,470
俺の飯がなんだって

405
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,390
Hak, you're awake?

406
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,380
ハク 起きたの

407
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,360
聞き捨てなりませんね

408
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,310
I can't let that one slide.

409
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,520
Is your wound okay?

410
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,620
傷大丈夫

411
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,350
My wound? What are you talking about?

412
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,250
傷 何の事です

413
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,650
それより俺の飯がなんですって

414
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,650
Anyway, what did you say about my cooking?

415
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,770
Cooking? What are you talking about?

416
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,120
飯 何の事

417
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,230
あ お腹すいた

418
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,780
Oh, are you hungry?

419
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,450
You're starting to dodge my questions.

420
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,540
躱すようになってきたじゃねか

421
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,780
Can you move? Do you want me to feed you?

422
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,880
体 動かせる 食べさせてあげようか

423
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,410
はい 口開けて

424
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,290
Here. Open your mouth.

425
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,810
姫様 そのような雑用は私めが

426
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,710
Princess, allow me to perform this menial task.

427
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,250
White Snake, don't butt in at the good part.

428
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,250
白蛇てめ いいとこ邪魔すんな

429
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,010
姫様に食べさせて貰うなど図々しい

430
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,300
How dare you make the princess feed you?

431
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,120
さて 食べ終わったら青竜の居場所なんだけど

432
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,800
If you've finished eating, I'd like to discuss the Blue Dragon's location.

433
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,670
キジャ 青龍の気配は

434
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,340
Ki-ja, can you sense the Blue Dragon?

435
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,650
向こうが何かもやっと

436
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,260
I feel something over there.

437
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,930
Yeah, okay. Sorry to bother you.

438
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,160
はい お手数をおかけました

439
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,210
青龍って白龍と同じく里があるの それとも一人

440
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,770
Does the Blue Dragon have a village like the White Dragon, or does he live alone?

441
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,030
それがよく分からないのだ

442
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,110
I'm not really sure.

443
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,900
各地に居る同胞からの情報だと

444
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,280
I have some information from
my compatriots living abroad.

445
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,620
Long ago, the Blue Dragon clan lived secretly in the Earth Tribe's territory.

446
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,610
青龍の一族は昔 地の部族の土地に隠れ住んでいたらしい

447
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,940
だが ある時を堺に

448
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,910
However, the Blue Dragon village suddenly disappeared, and the clan went missing.

449
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,140
青龍の里は忽然と消え 一族も行方不明になってしまったと

450
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,940
消えた でも滅びではいないんでしょう

451
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,920
Disappeared? But they weren't destroyed, right?

452
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,360
目と閉じれば 青き龍の鼓動を確かに感じる

453
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,260
When I close my eyes, I can feel the pulse of the Blue Dragon.

454
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,230
イクスが白龍以外は移動してるって言ってた

455
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,350
Ik-su said the other dragons move around.

456
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,720
たぶん 青龍一族は里ごと 何処かに引っ越したんだ

457
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,140
The Blue Dragon's clan must
have moved somewhere.

458
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,190
Ki-ja is pointing east-northeast
toward the Fire Tribe's land.

459
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,250
キジャの示す方向は東北東 火の部族の土地

460
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,400
I'd say there are about six locations where the village might be.

461
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,830
なら 里がありそうな場所は 六ヶ所かな

462
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,070
Yun, have you been there?

463
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,010
ユン 行った事あるの

464
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,920
ないよ でも

465
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,570
No, but the largest city after Saika is here.

466
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,780
Saika

467
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,760
この辺りは彩火の都に次ぐ大きな町があるし

468
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,660
There are merchant roads and
aristocratic villas in this area.

469
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,230
ここは商団が行き交う道や 貴族の別宅があるからね

470
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:51,870
Saika

471
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:51,950
Saika

472
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,030
Saika

473
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,120
Saika

474
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,200
Saika

475
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,280
Saika

476
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,370
Saika

477
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:52,780
Saika

478
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:52,870
Saika

479
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,950
Saika

480
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,030
Saika

481
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,120
Saika

482
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,200
Saika

483
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,280
Saika

484
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,370
Saika

485
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,660
Saika

486
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,720
それ以外で目立たず人も通らない土地となると

487
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,040
There are only about six other places that are
infrequently traveled and away from human eyes.

488
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,010
六ヶ所くらいに絞られるって事

489
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,770
凄い ユンって本当になんでも知ってるのね

490
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,840
Amazing! You really do know everything, Yun.

491
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,820
坊や扱いしないでくれる 一つしか違わないのに

492
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,050
Would you stop treating me like a little kid?

493
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,720
We're only one year apart.

494
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,870
よし 野郎共

495
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,930
All right, boys!

496
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,900
明日から本格的青龍探しだ つぅ訳でお休みなさい

497
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,680
Tomorrow we'll start searching for the Blue Dragon!

498
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,850
Anyway, goodnight.

499
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,020
Goodnight?

500
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,050
お休みって えっ ここで

501
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,480
Wait, here?!

502
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,810
Goodnight.

503
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,410
お休み

504
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,730
Wait.

505
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,300
ちょっ 待っ

506
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,180
うっせぇ 白蛇

507
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,060
Shut up, White Snake.

508
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,280
What?

509
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,050
げっそり

510
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,030

Dragon's Claw

803
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:58,560
Red-haired Princess

804
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:58,560
Red-haired Princess

805

00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:58,970
Dragon's Claw

821
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,450
無理だけど

822
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,100
Dragon's Claw

823
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,100
Dragon's Claw

824
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,350
Of course that's not possible.

825
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,180
Dragon's Claw

826
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,180

Dragon's Claw

829
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,470
Dragon's Claw

830
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,470
Dragon's Claw

831
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,600
Dragon's Claw

832
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,600
Dragon's Claw

833
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,770
Dragon's Claw

834
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,770
Dragon's Claw

835
00:15:59,770 --> 00:15:59,930
Dragon's Claw

836
00:15:59,770 --> 00:15:59,930
Dragon's Claw

837
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,060
Dragon's Claw

838
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,060
Dragon's Claw

839
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,230
Dragon's Claw

840
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,230
Dragon's Claw

841
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,350
Dragon's Claw

842
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,350
Dragon's Claw

843
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,960
キジャ

844
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,690
Ki-ja...

845
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,140
ここにはいない

846
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,900
He isn't here.

847
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,760
そう簡単にはいかないか

848
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,820
I guess it won't be that easy.

849
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,900
じゃ次はここから十里先の...

850
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,910
Next, we'll go forty kilometers ahead to...

851
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,980
待って そこはダメだ

852
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,620
Wait, we can't go there.

853
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,010
火の部族の軍の訓練場になっている

854
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,910
That's a training ground for the Fire Tribe army.

855
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,540
Huh?

856
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,330
What about here, then?

857
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,340
じゃ ここは

858
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,460
That area was recently developed.

859
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,290
そこは最近開拓されて

860
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm glad we didn't go there.

861
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,320
行ったらやばかったね

862
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,430
キジャ どうしたの

863
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,380
Ki-ja, what's wrong?

864
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,300
Nothing.

865
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,720
いえ

866
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
決まったよ

867
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,880
We've reached a decision.

868
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,050
It's a bit of a walk,
but we're down to three possibilities.

869
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,070
ちょっと歩くけど 候補地は三つに絞れた

870
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,930
The village will probably be one of them.

871
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,980
多分そこに里がある

872
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,180
Really?

873
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,250
本当

874
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,310
You know a lot about this area, Thunder Beast.

875
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,410
意外と詳しいね 雷獣

876
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,020
Well, I was a general.

877
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,850
ま 一応将軍でしたから

878
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,500
各部族の軍事とか変化には敏感なのよ

879
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,140
I'm sensitive to changes in the tribes and their armies.

880
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,900
今度教えてよ

881
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,850
Tell me more sometime.

882
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,150
Sure thing.

883
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
ま いいぜ

884
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,170
じゃ 行こう

885
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,820
Let's go.

886
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,070
キジャ

887
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,950
Ki-ja?

888
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,050
ここも居ない

889
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,830
Not here, either.

890
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,070
ここも

891
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,870
Or here.

892
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,520
キジャ どう

893
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,420
Ki-ja, anything?

894
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,780
ここもダメか

895
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
He isn't here, either?

896
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,160
向こうからもやっと

897
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,100
I feel something from over there.

898
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,640
What? He's still farther away?

899
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,180
へ また向こう

900
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,740
おかしいな それらしき所には行ったのに

901
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,560
That's odd. We visited all the likely places.

902
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,500
まさか青龍 国境超えたんじゃないだろな

903
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,440
The Blue Dragon didn't cross the border, did he?

904
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,900
Maybe your nose is congested, White Snake.

905
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,180
鼻が詰まってんじゃねぇか白蛇

906
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,720
鼻で嗅ぎ分けてるのではない

907
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,530
I'm not sniffing him out with my nose!

908
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,220
姫様 足を痛めたのですか

909
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,120
Princess, did you hurt your leg?

910
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,540
大丈夫 ちょっと疲れただけ

911
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm all right. I'm just a little tired.

912
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,740
飲んで

913
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,370
Drink this.

914
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,520
美味しい なにこれ

915
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,260
It's good! What is this?

916
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,100
琵琶の果実酒 飲むと疲労回復

917
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,380
Loquat juice. It eases fatigue.

918
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,490
三つ葉を足に貼っとくから 今日はもう休みな

919
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,470
I'll wrap your legs in honeywort.
You should rest for today.

920
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,060
Yun, you're amazing!

921
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,380
ユン凄い 物知り

922
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,310
You know so much!

923
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,940
H-How can they sleep in a place like this?

924
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,040
な なぜ このような所で眠れるのだ

925
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,850
皆 疲れたのだ

926
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,440
They're all tired.

927
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,940
何日も身を隠し 回り道をしながら歩き続けたのだから

928
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,660
They've been walking off the beaten trail for days while staying concealed.

929
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,050
私がもっとはっきりと四龍の居場所を感じる事が出来れば

930
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,450
If I could detect the dragons' locations more clearly,

931
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,500
the princess wouldn't have to exhaust herself.

932
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,760
姫様をあそこまで疲れさせてしまう事はないのに

933
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,060
ハクやユンの知識と知恵に頼るしかないとは

934
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,250
I have to rely on Hak and Yun's
knowledge and wisdom.

935
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,960
It's so frustrating.

936
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,100
悔しい

937
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,800
Blue Dragon, brother of dragon's blood...

938
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,650
青龍よ 龍の血を持つ兄弟よ

939
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,410
呼んでいるのだぞ

940
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,430
I've been calling out to you all this time.

941
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,070
ずっと ずっと...

942
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,500
我々の主が探しおられるのだぞ

943
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,730
Our master is searching for you!

944
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,410
其方もそこで待っているのだろう

945
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,100
You're waiting there, aren't you?

946
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,740
王を渇望しているのだろう

947
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,690
You'are waiting for the king, aren't you?

948
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,650
何時の間にか眠っていたか

949
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,450
I fell asleep.

950
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,050
なんだ

951
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,950
What was that?

952
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,180
姫様

953
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,130
Princess...

954
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,420
It's the middle of the night.

955
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,520
こんな夜中に

956
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,670
Princess-

957
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,760
姫...

958
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,780
邪魔すんな

959
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,680
Don't disturb her.

960
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,030
姫様は何時から弓を

961
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,680
When did the princess begin
practicing with a bow?

962
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,140
She's been practicing every chance she gets since before we met you.

963
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,100
あんたに会う前から 暇さえあればな

964
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,050
多い時は一晩200本

965
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,060
She shoots up to two hundred arrows a night.

966
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,760
200...

967
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,640
Two hundre-

968
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,890
Keep it down.

969
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
大声だすな

970
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,700
なぜあの様な無茶を

971
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,730
Why does she push herself so hard?

972
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,920
私が居るのだから 武術など必要ないのに

973
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,820
She has me. She has no need for martial arts.

974
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,160
Yeah, the princess has me,
so she doesn't have to do anything.

975
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,160
俺がいるからな 姫さんは何もしなくていいんだ

976
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,540
だが 姫さんは己の無力を許さない

977
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
But the princess finds her helplessness inexcusable.

978
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,360
父を殺され 城を逃れ

979
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,500
Her father was killed,
and she was exiled from the castle.

980
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,160
それでもこの世界で生き抜く為に

981
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,580
She's ashamed of her weakness.

982
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,180
一人で何もできない自分を恥じで

983
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,090
It drives her to find out what she must do...
in order to survive in this world.

984
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,520
何をすべきかもがいてる

985
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,970
You don't stop the princess
from wielding a weapon?

986
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,120
そなたは止めぬのか 姫様に武器など

987
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,720
I don't want her to fight.

988
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,870
闘わせたいわけじゃない

989
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,100
However, I'm conflicted,

990
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,160
でも困ったことに 見ていたいとも思う

991
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,940
because I also want to watch her struggle like a human being.

992
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,040
人間らしく 足掻く姿を

993
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,610
Damn these insects!

994
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,070
こんな虫など 虫など

995
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,720
あの方にお役に立ちたい お役に立ちたい

996
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,620
I want to help her.
I want to be useful to her.

997
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,480
今は守られてばかりだけど 何時かは私が守りたい

998
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,380
He protects me all the time now,
but someday, I want to protect him.

999
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,650
あの方も同じなのだ

1000
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,750
She's just like me.

1001
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,920
よし 今日こそ首根っこ引っ掴んでやるぞ 青龍め

1002
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,560
All right! I will find you today, Blue Dragon!

1003
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,790
キジャ 今日は眠れた

1004
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,770
Ki-ja, did you get any sleep last night?

1005
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,020
Huh? Ah, um...

1006
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,010
え あ あの

1007
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,430
疲れてるでしょう

1008
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,360
You're tired, aren't you?

1009
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,740
I can tell that sleeping outside bothers you, and you haven't been getting enough rest.

1010
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,540
野宿に慣れなくてずっと休んでないみたいだったから

1011
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,070
大事にして

1012
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,110
Take care of yourself.

1013
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,650
キジャが元気じゃないと旅は進まないんだから

1014
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,990
We can't make progress
if you're not feeling well.

1015
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,760
姫様

1016
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,660
Princess...

1017
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,830
Am I useful to you?

1018
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,050
私は お役に立てているのでしょうか

1019
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,050
Of course! No one could replace you!

1020
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,140
