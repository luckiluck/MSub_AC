kedakai hana no you ni

257
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,030

261
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,580
I will push through

Episode 15:      To a New Land

265
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,770
シンア 誰かいる

266
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,680
Sin-ha, is anyone there?

267
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,820
No? Then let's go.

268
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,720
いない

269
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,940
じゃ 行こう

270
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,210
遠視能力いいな

271
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,530
Your long-distance vision is fantastic!

272
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,410
It makes it easy to find deserted places.

273
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,680
人通りのないとこ探すの楽

274
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,090
お役に立っているぞ 青...

275
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,040
You're useful, Blue-

276
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,870
姫様から名を賜ったらしいな

277
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,920
I heard the princess gave you a name.

278
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,040
"Sin-ha." It's a good name.

279
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,980
シンアだ 良い名だ

280
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,050
You should treasure it.

281
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,100
大事にするのだぞ

282
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,230
よいか

283
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,180
Listen.

284
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,890
The story of the four dragons reaches back to the birth of the Kouka Kingdom.

285
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,950
四龍というのはだな...

286
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,570
キジャはシンアが仲間になって なんだか嬉しそう

287
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,890
Ki-ja seems happy to have Sin-ha with us.

288
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,270
私達は 旅するうち とある村に足を踏み入れた

289
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,440
During our travels, we entered a certain village.

290
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,520
ここは

291
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,570
This place...

292
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,610
見捨てられた 将軍や王からね

293
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,370
This village has been abandoned by the generals and the king.

294
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,740
この辺は何年も作物が実らなくて 水もない

295
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,750
For years, this area has been barren and dry.

296
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,500
男達は兵役にとられて 都に連れて行かれたんだろう

297
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,380
The men must have been taken to the capital to be trained as soldiers.

298
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,550
Disease has plagued the village,

299
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,630
病気が流行り 移住する力がない者はここで死ぬしかない

300
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,680
and those who lacked the strength to move are forced to die here.

301
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,830
ひどい

302
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,720
How awful.

303
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,700
俺の生まれた村もこんなもんだよ

304
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,020
The village I was born in was like this too.

305
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,100
The Fire Tribe's territory is broad, but most of the land is infertile.

306
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,390
火の土地は広いけど ほとんどが痩せた土地だし

307
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,190
But the chief, General Kang Su-jin,
keeps spending money on the army.

308
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,770
そのくせ 部族長のカンスジン将軍は

309
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,920
軍事にばかり金を回すしね

310
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,300
あほだな

311
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,240
What a fool.

312
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,570
大丈夫

313
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,530
Are you all right?

314
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,540
Stay back. You'll get sick too.

315
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,570
近寄らない方がいい 病が移る

316
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,490
But...

317
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,720
でも

318
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,120
気休めかもしれないけど 薬と水

319
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,090
It may not help much,
but here's some medicine and water.

320
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,480
あと 果物

321
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,760
And also some fruit.

322
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,410
はい

323
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,390
Here.

324
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,500
あんたら 彩火の人か

325
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,520
Are you from Saika?

326
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,570
いや 旅の者だよ

327
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,650
No, we're travelers.

328
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,680
そうか

329
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,150
I see.

330
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,360
Have you been to Kuuto, then?

331
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,660
なら空都には行ったかね

332
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,190
新しい王様が立たれたというが

333
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,950
They say a new king has been crowned.

334
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,520
どんなお方だろう

335
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,370
I wonder what he's like.

336
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,260
先王 イルはひどい王だった

337
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,290
The previous king, Il, was a terrible ruler.

338
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,380
Sai Kingdom

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,380

Kouka Kingdom

878
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,940
五部族はバラバラとなり 国は乱れるばかり

879
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,680
The five tribes were divided,
and the kingdom fell into chaos.

880
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,700
我々弱い民も救ってはくれない

881
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,230
He wouldn't even save weak commoners like us.

882
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,000
あれは 誰のための王だったのか

883
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,190
Whose king was he supposed to be?

884
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,580
今度の王様は 良い方だといい

885
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,610
I hope the new king is a good man.

886
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,340
この国を 変えてくださる方だといい

887
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,570
I hope he changes this kingdom.

888
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,770
娘さん ありがとう

889
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,160
Thank you, miss.

890
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,280
誰かに触れてもらったのは 何年ぶりか

891
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,790
It's been years since someone touched me.

892
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,540
いいえ

893
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,290
It's all right.

894
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,910
どうか お元気で

895
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,300
Please take care.

896
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,100
わ 私ちょっとご不浄に ついてこないでね

897
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,770
I need to use the bathroom.

898
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,360
Don't follow me.

899
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,080
I couldn't say anything.

900
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,990
俺 何も言えなかった

901
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,830
俺もイル王をよく思ってない人間だからさ

902
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,870
I didn't think highly of King Il, either.

903
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,590
But for Yona, he was her only flesh and blood.

904
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,500
でも ヨナにはたった一人の肉親なんだよね

905
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,990
先王の死を悼む者は 恐らく誰もいまい

906
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,970
It's likely that no one grieves for the late king.

907
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,300
歴史には 愚かな王であったと記されるだろう

908
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,260
He'll go down in history as a foolish man.

909
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,920
たった一人の姫など 気にかける者は誰も

910
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,100
No one cares about a single princess.

911
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,260
確かに

912
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,310
You're right.

913
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,790
武器も争いもなく 誰も傷つかない世界なんて

914
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,480
A world without weaponry and war,

915
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,770
where no one gets hurt, is just a pipe dream.

916
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,920
夢物語でしかない

917
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,830
だが

918
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,160
But I could never write off the king as a fool because of his unwavering belief...

919
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,100
それが理想だと言って揺るがなかった王を

920
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,760
俺は愚かだとどうしても思えなかった

921
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,700
that such a world would be ideal.

922
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,190
己の傷をそっと隠した背中を

923
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,950
He hid his own wounds.

924
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,390
臆病だと どうしても思えなかった

925
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,540
I didn't see him as a coward at all.

926
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,320
愚かだと思う主に 俺は従ったりしない

927
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,250
I would never serve a fool.

928
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,830
緋龍城で守り切れなかったこと 俺は生涯悔やむだろう

929
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,180
I'll probably regret my inability to protect him at Hiryuu Castle...

930
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,680
for the rest of my life.

931
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,900
雷獣は認めてたんだ

932
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,680
You acknowledged King Il as your master,

933
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,790
ヨナの父とかそういうのを別にして イル王を主だと

934
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,650
regardless of the fact that he was Yona's father.

935
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,590
当たり前だ

936
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,270
Of course.

937
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,990
忘れないでいて

938
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,440
Don't forget.

939
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,340
お前だけは 父上とその娘を 忘れないでいて

940
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,280
I want you to remember my father and his daughter.

941
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,370
I want you to remember my father and his daughter.

942
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,700
忘れるものか

943
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,990
I could never forget.

944
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,100
この国で最も華やかな娘だった姫は 今は一人

945
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,120
The princess, once the kingdom's
most beautiful girl, is now alone.

946
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,380
She has nothing but herself.

947
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,430
その身以外 何も持っていない

948
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:31,060
ただ 愛していた父との繋がりが
己の持つ たった一つの誇りなのだ

949
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,130
The only pride she has left is her connection to the father she loved.

950
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,240
強く ならなきゃ

951
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,380
I have to become stronger.

952
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,010
強く ならなきゃ

953
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,920
I have to become stronger...

954
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,060
皆や ハクを失わないために

955
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,010
so I don't lose Hak or anyone else.

956
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,120
私にできることは...

957
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,980
What else can I do?

958
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,980
Yona...

959
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,230
ヨナ

960
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,190
Don't. You mustn't handle weapons.

961
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,230
ダメだよ 武器など 決して触れてはならない

962
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,830
Father!

963
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,880
父上

964
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,670
So this is Chishin, capital of the Earth Tribe.

965
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,810
ここが地心 地の部族の都ですか

966
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,060
Lord Geun-tae!

967
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,100
グンテ様

968
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,760
イグンテ様

969
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,810
Lord Li Geun-tae!

970
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,210
なんだよ うるせぇな チョルラン

971
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,150
What is it? You're too loud, Cheol-ran.

972
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,860
A general shouldn't lounge around
dressed like this during the daytime.

973
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,940
ダメですよ 将軍ともあろうお方が

974
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,880
昼間からそのような格好でゴロゴロと

975
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,450
I'm still the same man, no matter what I wear.

976
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,390
どんな格好でも俺は俺だ 誰にも迷惑かけとらん

977
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,330
I'm not bothering anyone.

978
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,660
Live as the wind blows.

979
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,740
Besides, in the Wind Tribe,

980
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,120
それに 風の部族などは ハクといい 今の若僧といい

981
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,960
Hak and the youngsters wear
practically anything they want.

982
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,140
適当な服着ているぞ

983
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,330
Ambition? What's that?

984
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,580
Does it taste good?

985
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,390
あそこはもういいんですよ

986
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,580
Don't worry about them.

987
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,800
The Earth Tribe's been so dull lately.

988
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,100
地の部族は今 何かとぱっとしねぇな

989
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,930
I hardly see any merchants or
travelers from other kingdoms,

990
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,940
他国からの商人や客もさっぱり見かけねぇし

991
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,470
and our mineral resources are running low.

992
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,530
鉱物資源は先細りだし

993
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,390
Things were good during King Ju-nam's reign!

994
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,660
先々代のジュナム王の時代はよかった

995
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,720
都には人が溢れ

996
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,850
The capital was full of people.

997
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,010
戦となれば

998
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,560
During times of war, under the Kouka Kingdom's banner,

999
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,770
高華の旗の下 俺は襲い来る敵を鬼神のごとき強さで

1000
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,730
I struck down attackers with the strength of a fierce god!

1001
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,150
It can't be helped.

1002
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,110
仕方ないでしょう

1003
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,890
イル陛下の時代に 戦争は禁じられたわけですから

1004
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,110
Under King Il's reign, war was forbidden.

1005
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,450
Besides, you call yourself a fierce god,

1006
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,430
大体 鬼神って言いますけど

1007
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,030
グンテ様は試合で雷獣と呼ばれたど小僧の若者に負けたじゃないですか

1008
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,410
but you were defeated by the youngster known as the Thunder Beast.

1009
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,540
Very funny, Cheol!

1010
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,320
可愛いこと言うじゃねぇか チョルン

1011
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,260
そうなんだよ 体鈍ってから こんな非力になっちまって

1012
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,300
That's right. I've grown powerless because I'm so out of shape.

1013
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,590
すみません 突っ込みが過ぎました

1014
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,340
I'm sorry. I went too far.

1015
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,640
Lord Geun-tae! Lord Li Geun-tae!

1016
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,610
グンテ様 イグンテ様

1017
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,690
今度はなんだ 髭でも整えろってか

1018
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,720
What now? Are you going to tell me to shave?

1019
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,630
その 陛下が スウォン陛下がお見えになりました

1020
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,430
The king...

1021
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,680
King Su-won has arrived!

1022
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,310
Huh?

1023
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,690
It's really him.

1024
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,700
本物じゃねか

1025
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,570
This is why I warned you!

1026
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,760
だから言ったじゃないですか
早くお着替えになって下さい

1027
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,700
Hurry and get changed.

1028
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,320
You can't stay dressed like this.
The Sky General, Lord Han Ju-doh, is here too.

1029
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,790
まずいですよ ほら 空の将軍ハンジュド様もおいてですし

1030
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,720
なんでいきなり俺んとこ来るんだ こんな少人数で

1031
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,660
Why did they come to see me with so few people?

1032
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,040
I don't know!

1033
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,590
知りませんよ

1034
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,460
戴冠式以来ですね グンテ将軍

1035
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,040
I haven't seen you since the coronation,
General Geun-tae.

1036
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,940
お元気でしたか

1037
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,920
Have you been well?

1038
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,550
Yes, sir.

1039
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,060
はい

1040
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,630
スウォン

1041
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,380
Su-won.

1042
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,970
つい先だって 即位したばかりの弱冠十八の王

1043
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,010
The eighteen-year-old king, only recently crowned.

1044
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,520
Though there are some mysteries
surrounding the death of King Il

1045
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,900
先王イル崩御

1046
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,610
ヨナ姫 ハク将軍失踪については
不可解な点があるものの

1047
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,850
and the disappearances of
Princess Yona and General Hak,

1048
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,500
俺が心の師と仰ぐ ユホン様の嫡男

1049
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,440
he is still the heir of Lord Yu-hon,
the man I revered as my mentor.

1050
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,300
あの グンテ将軍 お願いがあるんですが

1051
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,360
General Geun-tae, I have a favor to ask of you.

1052
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
はい

1053
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,320
Yes, sir.

1054
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,630
将軍へのお願いですからね きっと極秘の任務ですよ

1055
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,530
He needs a favor from a general.

1056
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,570
It must be a top-secret mission.

1057
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,140
長旅で喉が渇きました お茶を一杯頂けませんか

1058
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,490
I'm thirsty from my long journey.

1059
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,080
May I have a cup of tea?

1060
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,370
Huh?

1061
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,340
This tea is wonderfully fragrant.

1062
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,680
凄く香りのよいお茶ですね

1063
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,120
女房自慢の茶畑で取れた茶ですよ

1064
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,090
The leaves are from my wife's
prized tea plantation,

1065
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,100
though it is too fragrant for me, personally.

1066
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,160
俺は香りがきつすぎて苦手ですがね

1067
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,570
花の香りだ

1068
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,680
It smells of flowers.

1069
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,700
女房が趣味で作ってるやつですから

1070
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,770
It's my wife's hobby.

1071
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,520
妙な味でも勘弁してやってください

1072
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,440
Please forgive any strange flavors.

1073
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,730
Really? I like it.

1074
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,790
そうですか 私は好きですよ

1075
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,650
Don't you agree, General Ju-doh?

1076
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,500
ね ジュド将軍

1077
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,380
俺は茶の味に さほど拘りはないですが

1078
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,320
The flavor of the tea doesn't concern me.

1079
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,320
グンテ 貴様 仮にも王にお出しする茶が失敗作とは何事だ

1080
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,080
However, Geun-tae, how dare you serve the king low-quality tea?

1081
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,460
Huh? No one said it was low-quality.

1082
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
あぁ だれも失敗とは言っとらん

1083
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,630
相変わらず固い男よ

1084
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,790
You're as stiff as ever.

1085
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,700
そのように年中眉間に皺を寄せておるから

1086
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,590
You still don't have a woman to serve you tea,

1087
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,590
because you furrow your brow year-round.

1088
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,940
茶を出してくれる女も出来んのじゃ

1089
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,050

美味しかったです 後で茶畑 見せてください

1477
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,820
It was delicious. I'd like to see
your tea plantation later.

1478
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,160
It's because you're so relaxed
that people don't take you seriously!

1479
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,030
貴方がそのようにぼへっとしておられる侮られるのです

1480
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,340
もっと王たるの威厳と自覚を

1481
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,370
You must have the self-awareness
and dignity of a king!

1482
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,770
はい ごめんなさい

1483
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,410
You're right. I'm sorry.

1484
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,480
これがユホン様の嫡男

1485
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,500
This is Lord Yu-hon's heir?

1486
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,730
気の抜けた頼りない男よ

1487
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,670
What a languid and unreliable man.

1488
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,500
憧れたユホン様の面影は欠片もない

1489
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,630
I don't see in him even a shred
of the Lord Yu-hon I admired.

1490
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,460
何方かと言えば イル王じゃねぇか

1491
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,800
If anything, he's more like King Il.

1492
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,740
ユホン様は比類なき最強の武人

1493
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,680
Lord Yu-hon was a peerless, powerful warrior.

1494
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,770
In my mind, he was the only true king.

1495
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,970
俺が認めた唯一の君主

1496
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,930
大丈夫か こいつは

1497
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,100
Will this man really make a decent king?

1498
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,540
地心城は初めてで 興味深いです

1499
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,280
This is my first time at
Chishin Castle. It's fascinating.

1500
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,810

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,610
It's beginning to show its age here and there.

1502
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,520
改装したいのですが お恥ずかしい

1503
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,240
We hope to remodel soon.
I'm embarrassed to show it to you.

1504
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,190
先立つもんがねぇもんな

1505
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,000
We can't afford to remodel now.

1506
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,170
でも城がぼろいのは

1507
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,380
But I heard the castle is in shambles
due to your rampages as a young man.

1508
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,610
グンテ様が若い頃暴れられたせいもあると聞いてますが...

1509
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,380
Lord Geun-tae!

1510
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,610
グンテ様

1511
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,170
What is it, Elder Hi-dea?

1512
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,230
どうした ヒデ爺

1513
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,840
Udo Mine collapsed again.

1514
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,700
ウド鉱山でまた落盤だ

1515
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,030
なんだと 怪我人は

1516
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,090
What? Was anyone hurt?

1517
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,680
若いのが十数人やられた

1518
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,390
More than ten of the youngsters.

1519
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,640
That place is dangerous.

1520
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,140
あそこはもうやべぇな 取り付くしちまったか

1521
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,310
Has it been exhausted?

1522
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,340
陛下

1523
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,100
King?

1524
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,270
Recently, the amount of iron ore extracted has declined,

1525
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,250
近頃は鉄鉱石の採掘量は...

1526
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,060
King!

1527
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,410
陛下

1528
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,270
Yes?

1529
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,280
あ はい

1530
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,980
What brings you to Chishin?

1531
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,040
陛下は地心に如何なるご用件か

1532
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,980
but the miners were digging new tunnels

1533
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,780
in an attempt to do something about the situation.

1534
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,610
陛下が直々にご光来なされたのです
きっと重要なお話がおありなのでしょう

1535
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,530
We are honored that you came here yourself.

1536
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,650
And it backfired.

1537
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,320
You must have something important to discuss.

1538
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,320
Send a horse.

1539
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,700
No, I'm just sightseeing.

1540
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,080
いえ 少し観光に

1541
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,700
Close the unfinished tunnels.

1542
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,330
I'll visit the injured later.

1543
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,370
観光

1544
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,330
Sightseeing?

1545
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,200
Yes, sir.

1546
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,200
Yes.

1547
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,430
はい

1548
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,000
Kouka Kingdom is in turmoil,
and the new king is sightseeing?

1549
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,680
この昏迷に陥った高華国を新王のあなたがのんびり観光ですか

1550
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,590
Some of our own tribe's regions
are unstable, such as Awa-

1551
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,500
我が部族にも不安定な地があるというのに 例えば阿波とか

1552
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,170
Ow.

1553
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,960
Watch your mouth.

1554
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,300
口を慎め 俺にしゃべるみたいにしゃべるな

1555
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,220
Don't talk to him like you talk to me.

1556
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,760
I don't mind.

1557
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,790
構えませんよ

1558
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,190
陛下

1559
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,060
King...

1560
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,190
What did you think of the previous king?

1561
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,390
陛下は 先王 イル王をどう思われておいてか

1562
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,010
グンテ様

1563
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,810
Lord Geun-tae?

1564
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,390
不敬ながら 俺は あの王には疑問を抱くばかりだった

1565
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,900
Please excuse me for saying so, but I found
the previous king's policies questionable at best.

1566
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,080
争いを避け 領土を譲り 国力が下はる一方

1567
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,240
He avoided conflict, gave up land,
and let the kingdom's strength decline.

1568
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,570
民のためと聞こえはいいが
救われた民はどこにいたのか

1569
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,160
Though he claimed it was for the people, where are these people he saved?

1570
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,280
南の真と斉には舐められ

1571
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,370
The southern Shin and Sei kingdoms
treated us like pushovers,

1572
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,170
戒帝国からは いつ襲撃されるのかと怯えた

1573
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,920
and I feared the Kai Empire
would attack at any time.

1574
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,170
Rather than just watch the king further disgrace and endanger Kouka,

1575
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,520
これ以上の屈辱を受け入れ

1576
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,370
高華を危険にさらすのならば

1577
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,070
もしかしたら 謀反を起こしたのは 俺だったかもしれん

1578
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,010
perhaps I was the one who rose against him.

1579
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,430
グンテ様

1580
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,310
Lord Geun-tae!

1581
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,480
グンテ

1582
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Geun-tae!

1583
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,080
おっと 違った

1584
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,310
Oh, my mistake.

1585
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,970
俺は謀反を起こしていたかもしれん

1586
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,810
I could have been the one to rise against him.

1587
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,570
Th-This man...

1588
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,630
こ こいつ

1589
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,780
Y-You're not making it much better!

1590
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,820
どどど どっちもダメですって

1591
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,190
He doesn't mean that, King!

1592
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,270
違いますよ 陛下

1593
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,160
O-Our tribe would never start a rebellion!

1594
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,120
ううう うちの部族は謀反だなんって

1595
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,080
俺が言いたいのは陛下
貴方様がイル王とどう違われるかということです

1596
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,700
What I mean to ask is this:
how are you different from King Il?

1597
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,210
この時期に観光などをし
のんきに茶など喜んでおられる

1598
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,290
In this time of crisis, you're casually sightseeing and drinking tea.

1599
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,410
それで この国は救われますかな

1600
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,960
Will that save our kingdom?

1601
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,590
At the coronation ceremony,

1602
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,520
貴方は戴冠式で

1603
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,330
先々代国王の時代のような強国へと
この国を再生させると申された

1604
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:53,340
you said you would restore this kingdom
to the mighty nation of two generations ago.

1605
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,470
Can you tell me with conviction
that you weren't lying?

1606
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,720
その心に 偽りなしと言い切れますか

1607
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,030
はい

1608
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,980
Yes.

1609
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,780
偽りはありませんよ

1610
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,110
I meant it.

1611
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,380
覇気がねぇ

1612
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,490
He has no ambition.

1613
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,450
偽りなしと言っているのに なんだ この脱力感

1614
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,540
He says he meant it,
but why is he so languid?

1615
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,420
What is this stone?

1616
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,110
なんですか この石

1617
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,130
Who cares about some rock?

1618
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,920
石なんかどうでもいいでしょう

1619
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,900
だってジュド将軍
こんなところに石が祭られているなんて

1620
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,010
But, General Ju-doh, who would expect to find a stone enshrined here?

1621
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,370
ダメだ

1622
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,050
It's no use.

1623
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,170
ダメだこいつは

1624
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,390
He's useless.

1625
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,660
ユホン様とは似ても似つかん

1626
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,720
He's nothing like Lord Yu-hon.

1627
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,680
とてもこの国を立て直せる器じゃねぇ

1628
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,230
He can't rebuild this kingdom.

1629
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,500
そいつは ウド鉱山から持ってきた石ですよ

1630
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,480
That stone came from Udo Mine.

1631
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,730
Oh? From the mine?

1632
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,100
鉱山から

1633
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,430
富と幸福を与えるものとして

1634
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,450
Our tribe has a custom of enshrining stones for good fortune and happiness.

1635
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,410
祭る風習があるんです

1636
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,390
確かに よく見ると 綺麗ですね

1637
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,530
Upon closer inspection, it certainly is beautiful.

1638
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,610
この石は高価なものですか

1639
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,240
Is this stone valuable?

1640
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,580
No, the stone itself has no value.

1641
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,650
いや それ自体に 値はつきませんよ

1642
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,620
What we want is iron ore.

1643
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,770
欲しいのは鉄鉱石ですから

1644
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,460
Excuse me, King.

1645
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,340
あぁ 失礼 陛下

1646
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,770
俺は色々と忙しい故 部屋に戻ります

1647
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,840
I'm busy. I must return to my chambers.

1648
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,000
御用の際は城の者にお申し付けください

1649
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,930
If you need anything,
please speak to a castle servant.

1650
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,980
こらグンテ 貴様

1651
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,930
Hey, Geun-tae! You bastard!

1652
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,930
How, exactly, are you busy?

1653
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,880
どこが忙しいんです どこが

1654
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,320
はい またお話しましょう グンテ将軍

1655
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,850
Very well.

1656
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,930
Let us speak another time, General Geun-tae.

1657
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,980
U-Um, King...

1658
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,820
あっ あのあの 陛下

1659
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,440
The rebellion Lord Geun-tae spoke of was just, well, a figure of speech.

1660
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,520
グンテ様がおっしゃられた謀反というのは
そのあの 言葉の綾と申しますか

1661
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,740
He causes us all kinds of trouble
with his exaggerations.

1662
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,830
あの方 時折ああいう大げさな嘘をついたりして
我々を困らせるので

1663
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,660
That is, it isn't how he actually feels.

1664
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,710
そのつまり 決して本心では

1665
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,080
It's all right.

1666
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,260
大丈夫ですよ

1667
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,330
咎めたりはしませんはら

1668
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,250
He won't be punished.

1669
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm sorry. Lord Geun-tae is slightly depressed.

1670
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,570
申し訳ありません
グンテ様は少し塞ぎ込んでおられるのです

1671
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,280
ジュナム王の時代より
猛将と謳われた方ですから

1672
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,260
Since King Ju-nam's reign,
he's been known as a great general.

1673
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,640
He believes he belongs on the battlefield.

1674
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,970
戦場こそが己の生きる場所と思っておられるのです

1675
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,680
この時代において

1676
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,270
In recent times, his inability to protect Kouka Kingdom with his strength has vexed him.

1677
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,190
自分の力では高華国を守れないのか歯痒いのでしょう

1678
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,990
あんなだらしない格好で
一見傍若無人に見えますけど...

1679
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,730
Though his slovenly appearance
does seem defiant.

1680
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,520
分かりますよ

1681
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,450
I understand General Geun-tae.
It's clear from watching you two.

1682
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,030
グンテ将軍のことは あなた達を見ていれば

1683
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,290
You speak frankly to one another
without concern for rank.

1684
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,700
みんな物怖じせず
上下関係なく互いに声を掛け合っている

1685
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,010
彼の人柄がそうさせているのでしょう

1686
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,710
It must be his character that allows it.

1687
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,860
私の大好きな人達にどこか似てます

1688
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,800
That reminds me of the people I love.

1689
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,700
あなたも グンテ将軍が大好きでしょう

1690
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,880
You love General Geun-tae, don't you?

1691
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,800
What?

1692
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,880
その髪型 将軍とお揃いです

1693
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,850
Your hair matches the general's.

1694
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,160
地の部族の至るところで
その馬のしっぽ 見かけました

1695
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,230
I have seen that ponytail everywhere throughout the Earth Tribe.

1696
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:55,610
Well, he truly looked gallant and
heroic on the battlefield.

1697
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,500
だって 戦場でのあの方は本当に格好よくて 勇ましくて

1698
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,280
そりゃ皆憧れたものです

1699
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,940
Everyone admired him!

1700
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,830
Just between us, becoming his servant was an extremely competitive process.

1701
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,860
ここだけの話 世話役になるのも
凄い競争率だったんですよ

1702
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,040
Don't tell him, though.

1703
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,990
あ でも あの方には言わないでくださいね

1704
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,210
調子に乗ったりしますから

1705
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,790
It'll just go to his head.

1706
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,540
What's so great about him? I don't get it.

1707
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,600
あの男の何がいいんだ 解せん

1708
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,080
そんなに格好いいなら

1709
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:19,050
If he's as impressive as you say,
I'd like to see the gallant General Geun-tae.

1710
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,140
私も見てみたいなぁ グンテ将軍の勇姿を

1711
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
そりゃま

1712
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,140
Of course, but there are no wars.

1713
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,390
でも戦があるわけではありませんから

1714
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,850
I understand.

1715
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,920
成程

1716
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,880
では...

1717
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
In that case...

1718
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,310
Lord Geun-tae! Lord Geun-tae!

1719
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,540
グンテ様 グンテ様

1720
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,090
グンテ様X3

1721
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,020
Lord Geun-tae! Lord Geun-tae! Lord Geun-tae!

1722
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,320
What is it? Shut up.

1723
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,360
なんだっつんじゃい 喧しい

1724
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,070
The king...

1725
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,570
陛下が

1726
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,990
I refuse to talk to that pampered boy.

1727
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,230
俺はもう あの坊ちゃんの相手はせんぞ

1728
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,830
そうではなくて スウォン陛下が戦をなさるそうです

1729
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,780
It's not that.

1730
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,950
Apparently, King Su-won is preparing for war!

1731
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,040
King Su-won! King Su-won!

1732
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,140
スウォン陛下*4

1733
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,080
King Su-won! King Su-won!

1734
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,040
Shut up! We heard you the first time!

1735
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,100
煩い 一度で伝わる

1736
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,580
You've d-decided to go to war?

1737
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,590
ついに戦を決意なされたか

1738
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,670
Who will we be fighting?

1739
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,830
相手はどこじゃ

1740
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,960
Is it Shin? Sei?

1741
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,340
真か 斉か やはり戒 任せ

1742
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,800
Is it Kai?

1743
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,510
Leave it to me!

1744
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,810
いや 分かっております まずは兵と武器を

1745
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,130
No, I know.

1746
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,880
First, we must prepare soldiers and weapons.

1747
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,020
グンテ将軍 戦と言っても 戦ごっこですよ

1748
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,930
General Geun-tae,

1749
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,930
it's only a war game.

1750
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,270
Huh?

1751
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,560
The generals are starved for battle,

1752
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,480
将軍は戦闘に飢えておられるし

1753
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,570
皆も将軍の勇姿を見たがっているので

1754
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,150
and the people wish to see their gallant heroes.

1755
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,650
I thought we might hold a festival in Chishin.

1756
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,630
地心の都で祭りなど催されては如何かと

1757
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,810
え えと それはつまり模擬戦ですかな

1758
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,410
U-Um, in other words, it's a mock battle?

1759
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,660
もっと気楽感じで

1760
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,740
It won't be a serious affair.

1761
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,900
祭りで死人を出すわけにはいきませんから 真剣はなしで

1762
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,330
I cannot allow anyone to die at a festival.

1763
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,830
We won't be using real swords.

1764
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,210
こんなんだ ジュド この腰巾着がと言いたいとこだが

1765
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,960
Ju-doh, you sycophant.

1766
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,380
That's what I'd like to say,
but I should thank you.

1767
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,900
礼を言う つい手が勝手に拳骨を

1768
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,800
My hands made fists on their own.

1769
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,010
You bastard. How dare you!

1770
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,320
貴様陛下に何を と言いたいとこだが

1771
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,810
That's what I'd like to say,
but I understand how you feel.

1772
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,610
気持ちは分かる

1773
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,580
貴様がしなければ 俺がやっていた

1774
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,520
If you hadn't done it, I would have!

1775
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
King!

1776
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,540
陛下

1777
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,640
そのように遊んでるひまなどないと申し上げたではないですか

1778
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,810
I told you this isn't the time for games!

1779
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,160
まぁ たまにはジュド将軍も楽しみましょうよ

1780
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,280
You should enjoy yourself
once in a while, General Ju-doh.

1781
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,650
The festival will be held in a week.

1782
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,540
開催は一週間後にしましょうか

1783
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,240
King,

1784
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,300
陛下

1785
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,860
地の部族は陛下の遊びにお付き合いする暇はございません

1786
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,910
the Earth Tribe doesn't have time
to play games with you.

1787
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,990
緋龍城へお戻りを

1788
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,910
You should return to Hiryuu Castle.

1789
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,000
Huh?!

1790
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,230
へい やらないんですか

1791
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,170
We aren't going to do it?

1792
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,670
We were secretly looking forward to it.

1793
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,050
我々密かに楽しみに

1794
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,050
What? You want to play games?!

1795
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,320
なに 遊びたがってんだ お前らは

1796
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,720
They don't want to play.

1797
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,520
遊びたいんじゃないんですよ

1798
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,430
Huh?

1799
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,850
グンテ将軍 あなたはご自分の魅力をご存知ないのです

1800
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,930
General Geun-tae, you seem unaware
of your own appeal.

1801
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,100
Huh?

1802
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,990
あ 後程 ウド鉱山へ怪我された方のお見舞いに行きたいのですが

1803
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,940
I'd like to visit the men who were
injured at Udo Mine later.

1804
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,610
I will show you the way.

1805
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,860
ご案内しますじゃ

1806
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,280
I don't understand.

1807
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,190
意味が分からん ユホン様どころじゃんぇ

1808
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,190
I shouldn't have compared him to Lord Yu-hon.

1809
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,280
He may be even worse than King Il.

1810
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,430
ひょっとして イル王より悪いんじゃ

1811
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,470
お茶が美味しい

1812
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,410
Such delicious tea.

1813
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,030
一体どうなっちまうんだ この国は

1814
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,120
What's going to happen to this kingdom?

1815
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:24,190
Crying tears for the days that won't return

ここが戦場ならば 貴方は確実に死にます

1841
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,180
If this place were a battlefield,
you would certainly die.

1842
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,800
Then... what will you do?

1843
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,030
さて どうしますか

1844
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,730
