I hope everyone is well

847
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,870
なにが仕事だよ

848
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:22,250

I hope everyone is happy

855
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,290
I hope everyone is happy

856
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,290

I hope everyone is well

859
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,290
I hope everyone is well

860
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,840
You don't make any money.
All you do is pray every day.

861
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,820
金も稼いでないくせに 毎日祈っているだけじゃん

862
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,210
Hurry and take off your dirty clothes!

863
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,190
ほら 泥も早く抜いて

864
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,890
You were driven out of the castle for making dubious claims about hearing God's voice, you know.

865
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,630
大体

866
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,210
神の声とか胡散臭い事言ってるから

867
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,050
城から追い出されたんでしょう

868
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,140
Why were you driven out of the castle?

869
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,950
どうして追い出されたの

870
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,220
呆れだ

871
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,520
I'm surprised.

872
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,020
You lived in the castle, but you didn't know?

873
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,000
城に居たくせに 知らないの

874
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,580
Episode 7:   Destiny

875
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,580
Episode 7:   Destiny

876
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,250
Move, move! Out of the way!

877
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,020
はいはい そこ退いて

878
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,770
You lived in the castle, but you didn't know?

879
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,690
城に居たくせに 知らないの

880
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,100
I didn't even know what was
happening within the castle.

881
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,180
私は 城の中の事も知らない

882
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,440
Hak! Hang in there!

883
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,260
ハク しっかり

884
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,780
Can you hear my voice?

885
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,920
私の声が聞こえる

886
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,170
ハク

887
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,700
Hak!

888
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,200
持ってて

889
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,490
Hold this.

890
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,650
退いて

891
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,410
Move.

892
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,410
He has a fever.

893
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,830
熱があるな

894
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,250
Hak...

895
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,500
ハク

896
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,050
I've treated it, but the fever
won't break for a while.

897
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,550
処置はしたけど 暫らくは熱引かないよ

898
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,610
今晩が峠ってとこから

899
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,590
Tonight will probably be the worst of it.

900
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,300
Save Hak!

901
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,430
ハクを助けて

902
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,470
I'm working on it.
I don't want him dying on me.

903
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,630
やってるよ 死なれると面倒だし

904
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,600
But I'm not a doctor.

905
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,520
でも俺は医術師じゃない

906
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,940
Don't just assume I can save him.

907
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,300
助けて貰うのが当然たと思わないで

908
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,070
あんた まだ助けた礼の一言もないじゃない

909
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,820
You still haven't thanked me for saving you.

910
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,790
此奴にも一度でも礼を言った事もあるの

911
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,110
And what about him?
Have you ever thanked him?

912
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,940
死にかけてまであんたを守ってんのに

913
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,820
He nearly died to protect you.

914
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,080
It's all right.

915
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,250
大丈夫

916
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,960
まだ死神様のお迎えは来てないから

917
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,870
The god of death hasn't come for him yet.

918
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,900
彼が戻ってきます

919
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,870
He'll come back.

920
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,260
Yun, you should be kinder.

921
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,030
ユン君 言葉優しく

922
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,510
But I hate kings and nobles and people like that.

923
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,900
だって嫌いなんだもん 王とか貴族とか

924
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,680
In her own way, she's fighting.

925
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,550
彼女も彼女的に闘ってる

926
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,050
少しお散歩しませんか

927
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,270
Would you like to go for a walk?

928
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,270
ユン君の薬はとても効くんですよ
僕も何度も救われました

929
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,030
Yun's medicines are very effective.

930
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,610
He's saved me countless times.

931
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,340
て...て...て

932
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,040
Ouch.

933
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,920
Are you okay?

934
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,520
大丈夫

935
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
Why do you live out here?

936
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,430
なぜここで暮らしてるの

937
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,610
流れのままに生きているうちに
自然とここへ辿り着きました

938
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,430
I was going with the flow,
and I ended up here naturally.

939
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,160
これでは答えになってないでしょうか

940
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,400
I suppose that doesn't answer your question.

941
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,540
ただ

942
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,820
It's just...

943
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,070
Even here, there are flowers that bloom.

944
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,690
こんな場所にも咲く花があるんですよ

945
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
あの

946
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Um...

947
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,110
ありがとう 助けてくれて

948
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,170
Thank you for saving me.

949
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,470
教えて欲しいの 貴方達神官の事

950
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,560
I'd like you to tell me about the priests.

951
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,730
I may not know anything now,
but I don't want to remain ignorant.

952
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,830
私は何も知らないけど アホのまま居たくない

953
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,860
Actually, I'm not a priest.

954
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,940
訂正するけど 俺は神官じゃないよ

955
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,910
I just take care of that useless priest who can't even look after himself.

956
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,990
あの生活力のない のほほん神官の面倒を見てるだけ

957
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,910
Long ago,

958
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,260
昔 神官は王をしても侵せない権威を持っていたんだよ

959
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,790
priests had greater influence than even the king.

960
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,830
Than even the king?

961
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,030
王も

962
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,300
Yeah. They were revered as messengers of God.

963
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,630
そう 神の使いと崇められてたからね

964
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,280
国の政に深く係わり

965
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,300
Priests were deeply involved in ruling the kingdom,

966
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,810
時には戦争をも左右した神官

967
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,550
and sometimes they influenced wars.

968
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,010
神がお怒りだからと 王を降ろされた者まで居たんだよ

969
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,760
One priest even deposed a king,
saying he had angered God.

970
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,140
So priests became a problem for the king.

971
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,430
そこまで来ると 王にとっては厄介な訳

972
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,690
During King Ju-nam's reign,
the Kingdom of Kouka was expanding

973
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,480
ジュナム王の時代 高華国は
他国にも領土を広げ 勢い付いていた

974
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,480
into other kingdoms' territories and growing stronger.

975
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,530
Apparently, Prince Yu-hon's
achievements played a major role.

976
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,960
そこにはユホン王子の功績が大きかったんだって

977
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,410
For Yu-hon,

978
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,060
そんなユホンにとって

979
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,990
priests that could threaten
the king's power were a nuisance.

980
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,250
王の力を脅かす神官は邪魔だったんだよ

981
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,000
So that's why my uncle drove
the priests from the castle.

982
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,390
だから伯父上は城から神官を追い出したのね

983
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,920
Isn't living in the middle of nowhere difficult?

984
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,850
こんな何もない所で大変ではない

985
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,300
Not at all.

986
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,170
俺は人里めんどういし イクスはここの方が落ち着く

987
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,010
I find villages troublesome,
and Ik-su can relax more easily here.

988
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,350
Villages are full of poor people.

989
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,190
人里は貧しい人間で溢れてる

990
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,580
豊かなのは都の一部だけ

991
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,510
Only certain cities are wealthy.

992
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,520
イクスは優し過ぎだから

993
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,520
Ik-su is too nice.

994
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,510
全てを助けようとしてできなくて

995
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,600
He once tried to help everyone.

996
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,170
心が病んだことがある

997
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,520
He became depressed when he couldn't.

998
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,620
彼奴は俺が居ないとダメなの

999
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,280
He can't live without me.

1000
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,500
ありがとう

1001
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,570
Thank you.

1002
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,640
また教えてね

1003
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,790
Teach me more sometime.

1004
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,050
Hak's gone?!

1005
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,230
ハクが居ない

1006
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,440
Hak...

1007
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,620
ハク

1008
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,310
ハクのバカ

1009
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,580
Stupid Hak!

1010
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,020
心外な

1011
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,290
I'm appalled.

1012
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,840
暗闇で座り込むなり 悪口ですかい

1013
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,380
You're sitting in the dark, badmouthing me?

1014
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,340
奇跡の生還を遂げてお元気そうで何よりです

1015
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,010
"I'm glad you made a miraculous recovery and seem to be feeling well."

1016
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,520
どうしました 怖い夢でも見ましたか

1017
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,470
What's wrong? Did you have a scary dream?

1018
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,940
そんな事じゃ泣かないわ

1019
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,270
I wouldn't cry over that.

1020
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,470
Oh?

1021
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,960
どこ行ってたのよ

1022
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,310
Where were you?

1023
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,730
I was looking for this.

1024
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,160
ちょいとこれを探しに

1025
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,810
Then you should've woken me!

1026
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,120
だったら私を起こしなさい

1027
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,110
I understand. You can't sleep alone.

1028
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,850
なるほど 一人じゃ寝られないんですからね

1029
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,790
添い寝しましょうか

1030
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,990
Should I sleep next to you? Here.

1031
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,990
You fool!

1032
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
戯け者

1033
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,660
You're injured.

1034
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,680
そんな怪我で

1035
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,240
Now I'm a fool?

1036
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,320
今度は戯け

1037
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,720
こんなにボロボロになって無茶して

1038
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,290
You're behaving recklessly
when you're a total wreck!

1039
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,000
I thought you were going to die.

1040
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,140
死んじゃうと思った

1041
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,020
勝手にいかないで

1042
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Don't go off without saying anything!

1043
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,630
You have to stay by my side!

1044
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,680
ハクだけは側に居なきゃダメ

1045
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,050
I want to die now.

1046
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,800
なんか 死にてぇな

1047
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,180
Huh?

1048
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,680
その不細工な泣き顔が結構きたんで

1049
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,560
I've had all I can take of that ugly crying face.

1050
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,140
I really want to die...

1051
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,880
一遍死んで あんたがどんだけ泣くのか すげぇ見たい

1052
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,230
and see how much you'd cry then.

2620
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,960
You're right.

2621
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,010
She says I have to stay by her side
as though that's easy.

2622
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,910
側に居なきゃダメ何て 簡単に言ってくれる

2623
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,340
頭は悪いですけど 髪はいいんじゃないですか

2624
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,600
Your brains might not be so good,
but your hair's all right.

2625
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,720
I should sew your mouth shut.

2626
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,830
その口 縫い付けてやる

2627
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,710
束ねる髪が無くなっても

2628
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,190
Even though she doesn't have enough hair to fasten,

2629
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,110
she still hasn't thrown away that hair ornament.

2630
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,020
まだあの簪を捨ててないくせに

2631
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,100
え 神官の家

2632
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,040
Huh? The priest's house?

2633
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,410
ここは

2634
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,130
This place?

2635
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes.

2636
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,300
What a coincidence.

2637
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,700
すげぇ偶然

2638
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,590
I know you're living in hiding,

2639
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,720
しかし 隠れ住んでるとは言え

2640
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,930
but I would've expected a priest's house to look more like a shrine.

2641
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,500
神官の家つったら もっと祠的なとこと思ったけど

2642
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,460
ちょっと 勝手に食べないでよね

2643
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,680
Hey! Don't eat that without asking!

2644
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,370
おぉ 神官様 お恵みを

2645
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,100
Please, priest, grant me your hospitality.

2646
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm not the priest!

2647
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,520
俺は神官じゃないよ

2648
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,520
神官様 どこに居たのかな

2649
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,610
Where did the priest go?

2650
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,920
神官様

2651
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,790
Priest?

2652
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,310
どうしたの

2653
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,590
What's wrong?

2654
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,800
I was dreaming about you.

2655
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,810
あなたの夢を見ていました

2656
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,620
あなたをこの世界の夢を

2657
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,770
A dream about you and this world.

2658
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,850
ヨナ姫 神の声を聞きたいですか

2659
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,150
Princess Yona, would you like
to hear the voice of God?

2660
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,120
ムンドクに神官様に道を示して頂くよう言われたの

2661
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,900
Mun-deok told me to have
the priest show me my path.

2662
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,660
Is a path something that must be shown to you?

2663
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,220
道とは誰かに示して貰うものですか

2664
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,540
I thought I was supposed to sit still
and not do anything.

2665
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,070
私は何もしないでじっとしてるべきなのかと思っていた

2666
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,960
But now that I've been chased, Hak nearly killed,

2667
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,610
でも追われて

2668
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,010
ハクは殺されそうになって自分も死にかけて

2669
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,590
and nearly died myself,

2670
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,180
my blood is so hot that it's practically boiling.

2671
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,160
血が熱くて 沸騰しそうに熱くて

2672
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,310
私だって自分の足で立って歩ける

2673
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,680
I can walk on my own two legs.

2674
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,790
生きたいと思ったの

2675
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,140
I want to live.

2676
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,560
I won't let anyone take my life or Hak's.

2677
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,190
私もハクの命も決して奪わせやしない

2678
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,940
私の願いは今はただそれだけ

2679
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,400
That's my only wish.

2680
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,610
I have nothing to ask of God.

2681
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,460
神様に聞く事何て

2682
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:50,650
いいえ あなたが生きると言う事は
普通に平和に暮らすとは違う

2683
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,240
No. For you, living doesn't mean spending your days in ordinary peace.

2684
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,830
Huh?

2685
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,920
あなたが生きると言う事は
この高華国を揺るがす嵐を起こすと言う事

2686
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,460
Your life will create a storm that will shake the Kingdom of Kouka.

2687
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,960
Priest?

2688
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,830
神官様

2689
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,900
あなたがただ真っ直ぐに生きたいのなら

2690
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,180
If you wish to simply live an honest life

2691
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,560
熱き血潮を止められぬのなら

2692
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,180
and cannot stop the hot blood in your veins,

2693
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,180
I will convey the voice of God to you.

2694
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,870
あなたに神の声を伝えましょう

2695
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,360
闇 落つる大地

2696
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,730
When darkness falls upon the land,

2697
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:25,200
When darkness falls upon the land,

2698
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:25,200
When darkness falls upon the land,

2699
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:25,200
When darkness falls upon the land,

2700
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,360
the dragons' blood will restore life once more.

2701
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,450
the dragons' blood will restore life once more.

2702
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,450
the dragons' blood will restore life once more.

2703
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,450
the dragons' blood will restore life once more.

2704
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,340
龍の血により 再び蘇らん

2705
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,660
In accordance with the ancient pact,

2706
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:34,080
In accordance with the ancient pact, when the four dragons are gathered,

2707
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:34,080
In accordance with the ancient pact, when the four dragons are gathered,

2708
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:34,080
In accordance with the ancient pact, when the four dragons are gathered,

2709
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,190
古の盟約に従い 四龍集結せん時

2710
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,030
when the four dragons are gathered,

2711
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,580
the sword and shield that protect the king will awaken.

2712
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,580
the sword and shield that protect the king will awaken.

2713
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,580
the sword and shield that protect the king will awaken.

2714
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,750
the sword and shield that protect the king will awaken.

2715
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,640
王守護する 剣と盾が眼覚め

2716
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,290
The red dragon will return at dawn.

2717
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,290
The red dragon will return at dawn.

2718
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,500
The red dragon will return at dawn.

2719
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,600

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,480
I don't know what this business
is about dragons or gods,

2806
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,400
龍とか神とかさっぱり分からんが

2807
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,980

this crackpot is selling!

2808

2904
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:06,070
Does the "red dragon" in the prophecy mean the mythological king?

2905
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,520
さっきの予言 赤き龍って神話に出てくる王の事

2906
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,410
You're familiar with the kingdom's creation myth?

2907
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,310
建国神話はご存知で

2908
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,240
Yes.

2909
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,410
The red dragon god took on human form

2910
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,540
赤き龍神が人間の姿になって

2911
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,460
and descended from heaven to rule a kingdom on Earth.

2912
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,460
天界から地上へ降り 国を治めていく話

2913
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,420
He was the first king of Kouka, King Hiryuu.

2914
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,790
それが高華国初代の国王 緋龍王

2915
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,510
My father used to tell me about him all the time.

2916
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,560
父上は昔よく話してくれたわ

2917
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,390
But once King Hiryuu became human...

2918
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,440
でもその緋龍王も人の身となってからは

2919
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,930
...he eventually had to fight humans.

2920
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,500
いずれ人と争う事になったのです

2921
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,430
The people's hearts filled with evil,

2922
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,410
人々の心は邪に満ち

2923
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,270
they forgot their god, and their country fell to ruin.

2924
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,100
神を忘れてゆき 国は荒れた

2925
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:47,030
Even King Hiryuu was captured by humans who desired power.

2926
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,530
緋龍王も権力を欲する人間達に捕えられた

2927
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,910
Just when everything seemed
on the brink of destruction,

2928
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,830
あわや討ち滅ぼされそうになった時

2929
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,330
four dragons descended from heaven.

2930
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,190
天界から四体の龍が舞い降りた

2931
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,830
"Hiryuu, we have come for you.

2932
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,390
緋龍 貴方を迎えに来た

2933
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:06,340
Let us destroy the humans, who have forgotten their faith, and return to heaven!"

2934
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,900
信愛と学びを忘れた人間など滅ぼし天界へ帰ろう

2935
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,130
Hiryuu rejected them.

2936
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,830
緋龍はそれに応じなかった

2937
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,850
"No, I am human now.

2938
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,450
いや 我はもう人間だ

2939
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,860
人に憎まれ 人に裏切られても 人を愛さずにいられないのだ

2940
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:19,480
Though the humans may hate me and betray me,
I cannot help but love them."

2941
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,910
龍達もまた 緋龍を愛し失いたくないと願った

2942
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,520
The dragons loved Hiryuu as well
and did not wish to lose him.

2943
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,690
In order to protect Hiryuu,

2944
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,670
四体の龍は緋龍を守るため

2945
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,950
they gave their blood to human warriors and granted them strength.

2946
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,470
人間の戦士に自らの血を与え 力を齎した

2947
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,370
One gained sharp claws that could tear anything apart.

2948
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:49,440
ある者は 何をも引き裂く 鋭い爪を

2949
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:49,440
ある者は 彼方まで見通す目を

2950
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,120
One gained eyes that could see across great distances.

2951
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:49,440
ある者は 天高く跳躍する足を

2952
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,790
One gained legs that could jump high into the sky.

2953
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,440
ある者は 傷つかない頑丈な体を

2954
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,460
One gained a strong body that could never be injured.

2955
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,050
"You are now our other halves.

2956
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,620
これよりお前達は我々の分身

2957
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,220
You will serve Hiryuu as your master, protecting him with your lives.

2958
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,240
緋龍を主とし 命の限りこれを守り

2959
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,270
You will love him and never betray him."

2960
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,250
これを愛し 決して裏切るな

2961
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,310
With the power of the dragon gods,

2962
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,410
龍神の力を手に入れた戦士達は

2963
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:11,240
the warriors led their tribes to protect Hiryuu and brought order to the kingdom.

2964
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,710
部族を率い 緋龍王を守り 国の混乱を鎮めた

2965
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,990
Before long, the red dragon grew
tired of fighting and fell asleep.

2966
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,990
やがて 闘い疲れた赤き龍は眠りにつき

2967
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,240
The mission of the four dragon warriors thus ended.

2968
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,150
四龍の戦士達は役目を終えた

2969
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,170
They thought of their king,
no longer moving, and wept.

2970
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,790
彼らはもう動かない王を思い泣いた

2971
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,880
They did not know whether they grieved the loss of someone precious,

2972
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,210
大切な人を失った悲しみなのか

2973
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,410
自身の中にある龍神の血が緋龍の死を悲しんでいるのか

2974
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,050
or if the dragon god blood within
them mourned Hiryuu's death.

2975
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,610
彼らには分からなかった

2976
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,480
それから四龍の戦士達は
自らの力を人の手に余るものと部族の元を去り

2977
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,480
Realizing their power was beyond human control,

2978
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,340
部族の元を去り

2979
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,060
the four dragon warriors left
their tribes and disappeared.

2980
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,850
それぞれいずにかへ消えたと言う

2981
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:51,720
残された部族は独自の発展を遂げ 今の五部族となったのです

2982
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,110
The tribes they left behind continued
developing on their own,

2983
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,740
forming the five tribes of today.

2984
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,160
建国神話

2985
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,410
The kingdom's creation myth...

2986
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,700
それが私に何の関係か

2987
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,870
What does that have to do with me?

2988
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,700
ヨナ姫は生きたいと言いましたね

2989
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,920
You said you wanted to live, correct?

2990
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,940
はい

2991
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,080
Yes.

2992
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,880
でも一人では生きられない

2993
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,800
But you cannot live on your own.

2994
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,220
If you leave this place, your life
will be in danger again.

2995
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,300
外に出れな また命を狙われるから

2996
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,430
貴方の側には貴方を支えるハク殿が居る

2997
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,430
You have Master Hak supporting you.

2998
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,100
しかし このままではハク殿は死にます

2999
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,350
However, at this rate, Master Hak will die.

3000
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,990
ちょっとまって 勝手に殺すな

3001
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,140
Hey, wait. Don't write me off like that.

3002
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,490
神の声なんざ 俺は聞こえねぇ そんな...

3003
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,360
I can't hear the voice of God. I'm not-

3004
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,300
脅しかけても布施は出さんか...ら...な

3005
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm not giving you alms, no matter how much you threaten me.

3006
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,880
この様に 非常にやばい

3007
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,410
As you can see, the situation is grave.

3008
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,920
貴方には味方が必要なのです

3009
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
You need allies.

3010
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,960
でも 誰が

3011
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,580
But who?

3012
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,160
四龍の戦士を探しに行かれよう

3013
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,130
You must search for the four dragon warriors.

3014
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,300
You mean the four dragon warriors of legend?

3015
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,270
四龍の戦士って 伝説の

3016
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,840
居るの 居るの

3017
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,840
They exist?! They really exist?!

3018
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,590
Yeah, right. They're from the age of legends.

3019
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,590
まさか 神話の時代だぞ

3020
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,650
居ますよ

3021
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,050
They do exist.

3022
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,810
Even now, they live quietly in this kingdom, with the dragon blood they inherited.

3023
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,680
彼らは今でもこの国でひっそりと龍の血を受け継いで生きている

3024
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,220
彼らが力を貸してくれるでしょう

3025
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,690
They will lend you their strength.

3026
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,410
神官様 私はハク死なせたくない

3027
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,030
Priest, I don't want Hak to die.

3028
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,810
けど伝説の龍達はこんな私事で力を貸してくれるかしら

3029
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:20,660
But I'm not sure the legendary dragons
will lend their strength to someone like me.

3030
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,160
貴方はあの夜 奇跡的に命を拾い

3031
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,330
That night,

3032
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,000
you miraculously escaped death.

3033
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,760
城から奇跡的に逃げ延び

3034
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,250
You miraculously escaped the castle.

3035
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,520
この奈落の崖を落ちて 奇跡的に無事でした

3036
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,460
And you miraculously survived a fall into this abyss.

3037
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,920
それはもう奇跡ではなく

3038
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,920
I believe those were not miracles,

3039
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,180
but God's will leading you here.

3040
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,260
ここへ導かれつ天命だったのだと僕は思います

3041
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,880
伝説の四龍をもし見つける事が出来たなら

3042
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,020
If you find the legendary dragons,

3043
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,940
それは貴方だけ願いだけではなく 天命なのです

3044
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,890
it will be not only your wish, but God's will.

3045
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,410
天命

3046
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,440
God's will...

3047
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,730
However,

3048
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,290
しかし 天は道を示すだけ

3049
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,650
heaven can only show you the way.

3050
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,780
You must walk the path yourself.

3051
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,780
歩いてゆくのは 貴方自身です

3052
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,050
I don't know anything.

3053
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,630
私は何も知らない

3054
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,660
城の中も 外も

3055
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,680
Not about the castle or the rest of the world.

3056
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,920
イル陛下はもう目を開けません

3057
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,850
King Il will not wake again.

3058
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,760
分からない

3059
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,600
I don't know.

3060
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,190
I love your hair, Yona.

3061
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,160
私は好きですよ ヨナの髪

3062
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,620
I want to know...

3063
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,140
私は知りたい

3064
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,430
知らずに通り過ぎた事を

3065
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,330
the feelings of others and the many other things...

3066
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,630
that I once passed by heedlessly.

3067
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,900
色んな人の思いを

3068
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,250
強くなりたい

3069
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,210
I want to become stronger.

3070
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,920
Princess?

3071
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,210
姫さん

3072
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,720

3073

死にませんよ 俺は

3164
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,160
ハク 私 四龍の血を持つ人に会ってみたい

3165
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,860
Hak, I want to meet the people
with the dragons' blood.

3166
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,900
会ってどうする

3167
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,030
Why meet them?

3168
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,720
そんな奴等居ないかもしれないし

3169
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,660
They may not exist. And if they do,
they may not be your allies.

3170
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,630
いても味方とは限らない

3171
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,320
その時はその時よ

3172
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,250
I'll worry about it then.

3173
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,120
At this rate, I can't even leave this place.

3174
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,650
このままでは ここを出る事さえ出来ないもの

3175
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,080
何とかして前に進みたいの

3176
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,290

3177
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,390
私も強くなるから

3178
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,630
I will become stronger.

3179
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,410
私に剣とか弓とか教えて

3180
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,380
Teach me to use a sword and bow.

3181
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,260
I'll learn.

3182
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,740
覚えるから

3183
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,260
I don't want to die in this absurd state.

3184
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,940
不条理なまま 死ぬのは嫌

3185
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,260
お前を失うのはもっと嫌

3186
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,180
Even more, I don't want to lose you!

3187
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,740
その為なら

3188
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,310
To prevent that,

3189
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,890
神の力だろうと 私は手に入れたい

3190
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,810
I will acquire even the power of the gods.

3191
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,190
I'm telling you that I won't die.

3192
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,400
死なねぇつってんのに

3193
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,740
ま 姫様の思し召しなら

3194
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,650
Well, if that's what you want,

3195
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,240
I guess I'll take a chance on
God's will or whatever it is.

3196
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,430
その天命とやらに賭けますか

3197
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,810
ハク 最近いい子ね よしよし

3198
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,370
Hak, you've been a good boy lately. There, there.

3199
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,590
あんまり近づかないで貰えます

3200
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,210
Please don't get too close.

3201
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Why?

3202
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,790
どうして

3203
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,880
Because it's annoying.

3204
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,280
鬱陶しいから

3205
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,420
What?!

3206
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,410
なに

3207
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,790
You have more wrinkles.

3208
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,920
皺増えてる

3209
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,750
You're kidding!

3210
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,140
嘘でしょう

3211
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,880
If you're angry all the time,
you'll become a wrinkly old lady.

3212
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,100
あんまイライラしてると
皺皺のばあさんになって仕舞いますよ

3213
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,340
That's none of your business!

3214
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,460
余計なお世話よ

3215
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,390
今のでまた増えた

3216
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,470
Now you have even more!

3217
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,600
Hak, you idiot!

3218
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,680
心は決まりました

3219
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,600
Have you made up your mind?

3220
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,480
Yes.

3221
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,090
お二人に お願いがあるのです

3222
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,610
I have a favor to ask of you two.

3223
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,650
ま こんなもんでしょう

3224
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,790
Well, that should do it.

3225
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,770
Do you see

3226
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,770
Do you see

3227
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,770

3230
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:23,360
What I'm trying so hard to convey through my work?
