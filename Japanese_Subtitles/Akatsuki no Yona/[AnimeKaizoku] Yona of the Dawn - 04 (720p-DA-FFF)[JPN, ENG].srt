1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,450
I'm fine.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,470
平気ですよ

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,160
A little snake bite isn't going to stop General Hak.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,180
蛇に噛まれたくらいでどうにかなる ハク将軍じゃありません

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,370
Um, Hak?

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,410
あの はく

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,830
Yes?

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,530
はい

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,140
何処かの里に下りて 食べ物とか薬を

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,130
Couldn't we head down into some village for food and medicine?

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,090
Villages are dangerous.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,880
人里は危険です

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,660
例え村人が俺らの顔を知らなくても
城の兵は何処に居るでも知れない

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,340
Even if the villagers don't recognize us,
soldiers from the castle could be anywhere.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,820
じゃ 今どこへ向かってるの

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Then where are we going?

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,190
恐らく今 俺らにとって唯一頼れる場所

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,980
Probably the only place we can count on now.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,480
Capital Fuuga, my home.

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,350
風牙の都 俺の故郷です

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,470
まだ城から何も聞いてね様だな

1068
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,450
Looks like they haven't heard
anything from the castle yet.

1069
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,420
My, who is this girl?

1070
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,390
あら 誰この子

1071
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,790
ハク様の女

1072
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,920
Is she your woman?

1073
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,080
What?

1074
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,590
違う 城の見習い女官だ

1075
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,460
No, she's a court lady in training.

1076
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,170
No way! So what's your name?

1077
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,790
嘘だ な 名前は

1078
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,130
Huh?

1079
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,370
出身は もしかして空都

1080
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,300
Where are you from? Are you from the Sky capital?

1081
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Hey, what's Hiryuu Castle like?

1082
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,370
ねね 緋龍城ってどんなとこ

1083
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,050
How old are you?

1084
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,080
あんた今 年は幾つなの

1085
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,010
Um...

1086
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,260
あの...

1087
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,010
倒れちゃった

1088
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,100
She collapsed!

1089
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,220
あれ まぁ 弱っちい娘だな

1090
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,810
Oh, my, what a weak girl.

1091
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,620
すぐに寝所と食事の用意を

1092
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,310
Prepare a bed and food immediately.

1093
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,730
あの若長が女性に優しくしている

1094
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,820
The young lord's being kind to a woman.

1095
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,210
聞こえなかったのか

1096
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,280
Didn't you hear me?

1097
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,590
は はい

1098
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,570
Y-Yes, sir.

1099
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,170
爺ちゃん...ムンドク長老はどこに居る

1100
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,240
Where's the old man, Elder Mun-deok?

1101
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,190
長老なら 緋龍城だよ

1102
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,200
He's at Hiryuu Castle.

1103
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,990
なに

1104
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,080
What?

1105
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,150
やっぱり知らないんだ

1106
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,790
You didn't know?

1107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,500
The five tribes were suddenly summoned to a meeting at the castle.

1108
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,700
急に城から五部族召集令が下ったんだよ

1109
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,710
A meeting of the five tribe?

1110
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,970
五部族召集だと

1111
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,840
普通なら 城に居る若長が出席すればいいでしょう

1112
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,920
Normally, the young lords of the castle attend.

1113
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,900
既に将軍を退いたムンドク長老が呼ばれたから
変だなと思ったんだ

1114
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,340
I thought it was strange that they summoned Elder Mun-deok,

1115
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,640
when he's retired from being a general.

1116
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,500
ハク様やっぱり首ですか

1117
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,510
Lord Hak, were you really fired?

1118
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,130
一体どう言う事だ

1119
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,850
What's the meaning of this?

1120
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,990
急な呼び出しがあったかと思えば 国王崩御だと

1121
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,610
We're called here suddenly,
and they tell us the king is dead?

1122
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,080
ヨナ姫もソンハク将軍も行方不明だの事

1123
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,820
Princess Yona and General Hak are missing too.

1124
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,870
Elder Mun-deok, don't you have some idea where General Hak might be?

1125
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,170
ハク将軍の行方についてムンドク長老は何かご存知なのでは

1126
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,730
何が言いたい 火の部族の若僧よ

1127
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,540
What are you trying to say, Fire Tribe boy?

1128
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,590
城内ではこんな噂が広がっておりますぞ

1129
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,630
There's a rumor going around the castle

1130
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,420
陛下はハク将軍によって殺害され
ヨナ姫は人質として彼に連れ去られたと

1131
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,050
that General Hak killed the king and took Princess Yona hostage.

1132
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,820
決めつけるのは良くないな

1133
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,890
It isn't good to make assumptions.

1134
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,370
行方が分からないのだから
ハク将軍にも何かあったのでは

1135
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,180
We don't know where General Hak is.
Perhaps something happened to him as well.

1136
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,110
That Thunder Beast's strength surpassed mine when he was just thirteen years old.

1137
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,370
あの雷獣は齢十三にして我をも凌ぐ力を持っていたんだぞ

1138
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,400
He wouldn't die so easily.

1139
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,390
そう簡単に死ぬものか

1140
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,800
お静かに

1141
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,780
Quiet.

1142
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,280
Three days ago, the king was murdered,

1143
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,350
陛下は三日前 何者かに弑逆され
ヨナ姫もハク将軍も行方知れずです

1144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,910
and both Princess Yona and General Hak are missing.

1145
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,930
では やはり...

1146
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,910
Then it's true?

1147
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,550
この件は我々に任せて頂きたい

1148
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,670
Leave this matter to us.

1149
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,620
もし彼らを見つけたら 城に連絡を

1150
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,830
If you find them, contact the castle.

1151
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,130
許可なく危害を加えたり外部に公表したりなさらぬよう

1152
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,880
Do not harm them or inform
anyone else without permission.

1153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
But...

1154
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,080
しかし...

1155
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,470
Publicizing this information would bring chaos to the kingdom.

1156
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,300
この件を公にすれば 国内の混乱を招き

1157
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,420
部族同士の争いを煽るだけでしょう

1158
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,100
The tribes would begin fighting among themselves.

1159
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Chishin

1160
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Fuuga

1161
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Kouka Kingdom

1162
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Saika

1163
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Sei Country

1164
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Shin Country

1165
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Suiko

1166
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
The Empire

1167
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 349 48 l 447 48 447 86 349 86

1168
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 382 199 l 431 199 431 227 382 227

1169
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 431 446 l 482 446 482 475 431 475

1170
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 511 507 l 575 507 575 543 511 543

1171
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 540 178 l 673 178 673 213 540 213

1172
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 723 497 l 792 497 792 538 723 538

1173
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 726 326 l 782 326 782 359 726 359

1174
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
m 771 122 l 822 122 822 151 771 151

1175
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,590
今は一刻も早く 我々五部族が力を合わせ

1176
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,100
What the five tribes must do now is work together to strengthen Kouka Kingdom.

1177
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,260
高華王国を他国に侵されない強国にしなければ

1178
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,860
Otherwise, it will be invaded by another country.

1179
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,820
確かに

1180
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,020
You're right.

1181
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,600
イル陛下は争いを避けるあまり
他国に国土を譲り貢物を差し出したわ

1182
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,740
To avoid conflict, King Il gave other countries land and made offerings to them.

1183
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,190
今や高華王国の権威は地に落ちている

1184
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,280
Our kingdom's political influence is all but gone.

1185
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,790
国内で争っている時ではない

1186
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,370
Now is no time for civil war.

1187
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,770
それには 新王が必要ですな

1188
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,750
In that case, we need a new king.

1189
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,430
恐れながら ヨナ姫が不在の今

1190
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,500
With all due respect, in Princess Yona's absence,

1191
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,880
王家の血を引いておられるのは
ここに居るスウォン様しかおりますまい

1192
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,470
the only one with royal blood is Lord Su-won.

1193
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,950
本来なら皇太子のくらいにあるお方
新王に即位されるのに何の問題も御座いません

1194
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,930
He should have been the crown prince in the first place.

1195
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,720
There's no problem with crowning him as king.

1196
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:23,170
然り スウォン様が新王となられるならば
このカンスジン 誠心誠意お使え申し上げます

1197
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:22,730
I, Kang Su-jin, sincerely approve of
Lord Su-won becoming the new king.

1198
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,620
他の部族長は如何ですか

1199
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,690
How do the other tribe leaders feel?

1200
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,100
え スウォン様ならば

1201
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,110
Yes, I approve of Lord Su-won.

1202
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,690
異存ありません

1203
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,360
No objections here.

1204
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,580
I'm tired.

1205
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,460
眠い

1206
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,390
眠い眠い

1207
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,540
I'm so tired.

1208
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,170
難しい話は年寄りには眠いわ

1209
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,250
Complex discussions tire the elderly.

1210
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,480
わしは帰る

1211
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,250
I'm leaving.

1212
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,960
Lord Mun-deok, we aren't finished yet!

1213
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,840
ムンドク様 話はまだ

1214
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,770
わしは将軍ではない

1215
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,630
I'm no general.

1216
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,070
その話はハクを呼んでからにするんじゃな

1217
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,760
You should discuss this matter
after you've summoned Hak.

1218
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,380
スウォン様を王に承認なさらないのなら

1219
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,470
If you refuse to acknowledge
Lord Su-won as the king,

1220
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,700
風の部族は益々謀叛の疑いをかけられますぞ

1221
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,850
that will be all the more reason to suspect the Wind Tribe of rebellion.

1222
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,500
五部族全ての承認を得られなくては私は王にはなれません

1223
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,110
Without approval from all five tribes,
I cannot become king.

1224
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,990
王がいなければ 国は立ちゆきませんし

1225
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,240
But a kingdom won't last without a king.

1226
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:16,510
スウォン様がヨナ姫と婚礼をあげて
正式に高華の王となられるのでしたら

1227
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,700
If you were to marry Princess Yona and formally become king,

1228
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,040
わしは大喜びで祝いの品を献上したじゃろう

1229
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,040
I would happily present you with a celebratory gift.

1230
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,390
ハクは理由もなしに城を去ったりはせぬ

1231
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,130
Hak wouldn't leave the castle without reason.

1232
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,080
三日後 新王即位式を執り行います

1233
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,010
Three days from now,
we will hold the coronation ceremony.

1234
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,500
ムンドク長老は必ず来て下さると信じています

1235
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,550
I know you will come, Elder Mun-deok.

1236
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,530
風牙の都の民のためにも

1237
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,060
For the sake of the people of Capital Fuuga.

1238
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,550
悲しい事です

1239
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,230
It's sad.

1240
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,120
スウォン様 あなたの事はハク同様 孫の様に思っていた

1241
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,190
Lord Su-won, I used to think of you
as a grandson, like Hak.

1242
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,060
ご苦労様でした

1243
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,360
Good work.

1244
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,350
少しお甘いのでは

1245
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,870
Shouldn't you be a little more concerned about this?

1246
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,570
ヨナ姫やハク将軍を追わず殺さずとは

1247
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,910
If you don't hunt down Princess Yona and General Hak and kill them,

1248
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,860
もし二人の口から真実が広まれば...

1249
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,710
and they spread the truth-

1250
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,670
Hak is no fool.

1251
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,530
ハクはバカじゃないです

1252
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,650
真実を広め騒ぎを起こせば 逆にヨナ姫の命が危ない

1253
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,340
If he spreads the truth and starts an uproar,
Princess Yona will be in danger.

1254
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,080
姫を守るため 今はじっと息を潜めている事でしょう

1255
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,760
I'm sure he'll stay silent for the present,
to protect the princess.

1256
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,940
General Kang, begin preparations to quell a Wind Tribe rebellion.

1257
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,750
風の部族の反発に備えて
カン将軍は次の計画に移って下さい

1258
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,240
御意

1259
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,230
As you wish.

1260
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,960
ありがとう

1261
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,570
Thank you.

1262
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,660
I was happy to hear you say that you considered me a grandson, Master Mun-deok.

1263
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,540
孫の様にって言ってくれて嬉しかったです ムンドク師匠

1264
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,920
どこ

1265
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,040
Where am I?

1266
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,460
服 新しい

1267
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,630
I have new clothes.

1268
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,980
起きたのか

1269
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,670
Are you awake?

1270
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,960
よし 熱は下がったな

1271
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,930
Good. Your fever's gone down.

1272
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,190
Eat lots of food, and get well soon.

1273
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,980
沢山飯食って早く元気になれよ

1274
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,660
いい匂い

1275
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,650
It smells nice.

1276
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,810
It's good.

1277
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,680
旨いぞ

1278
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,640
何で泣くんだ 不味かった

1279
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,280
Why are you crying? D-Does it taste bad?

1280
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,800
暖かくて

1281
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,530
It's so warm.

1282
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,490
暖かくて泣くのか 変な奴だな

1283
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,950
You're crying because it's warm?
You're strange.

1284
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,760
父上を思い出して

1285
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,670
It made me remember my father.

1286
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,530
俺はテヨン ハク兄ちゃんの弟だ

1287
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm Tae-yeon, Hak's younger brother.

1288
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,860
ハクの弟

1289
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,920
Hak's younger brother?

1290
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,440
お前はハク兄ちゃんの友達か

1291
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,260
Are you Hak's friend?

1292
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,500
たぶん

1293
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,510
Probably...

1294
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,510
You're probably friends?!

1295
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,800
たぶん友達

1296
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,600
That's awful. Even if you can't be lovers...

1297
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,500
そんな 愛人とか恋人とかは無理にしても

1298
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,770
たぶん友達って視界にも入ってねぇっす

1299
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,850
...you might not even be friends?
So he's totally out!

1300
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,420
哀れ ハク様超片思い

1301
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,610
Poor Lord Hak! And his feelings are so strong-

1302
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,900
Who are you calling your friend?

1303
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,920
誰が友達だ

1304
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,390
え じゃ 従者...

1305
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,360
Huh? Then, my attendant-

1306
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,110
Your name is Rina.

1307
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,810
あんたの名はリナ

1308
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,410
城の見習い女官と言うことになってる

1309
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,820
You're a court lady in training.

1310
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,570
Got it?

1311
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,330
いいな？

1312
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,740
Okay, that's a good girl.

1313
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,580
よし いい子だ

1314
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,620
There's something naughty about this, Lord Hak!

1315
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,540
だっておやらしいよハク様

1316
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,620
We aren't doing anything Tae-yeon shouldn't see!

1317
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,780
テヨンが見て不味い事はなんもしてねぇだろが

1318
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,840
Rina, what is my brother like at the castle?

1319
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,510
リナ 兄ちゃんは城ではどんな人なの

1320
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,630
At the castle, Hak is...

1321
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,650
城でのハクは

1322
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,260
If anything isn't right, it would be her brain.

1323
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,510
脳味噌が変ですね

1324
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,800
If anything isn't right, it would be her brain.

1325
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,590
...rude.

1326
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,410
無礼者

1327
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,720
No, he's insensitive and arrogant. Oh, and not lovable. Also-

1328
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,640
あいや 無神経 えっと態度でっかい うん可愛くない 後...

1329
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,810
Okay, we get it. That's enough.

1330
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,730
よし分かったもういい

1331
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,190
Miss Rina, you're the best.

1332
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,110
リナさん最高

1333
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,520
Nothing lovable about him!

1334
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,910
そりゃ可愛くねぇわ

1335
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,770
You two look like you're having fun.

1336
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,700
楽しそうだな二人共

1337
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,670
皆笑顔で賑やか これがハクの育った場所

1338
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,150
Everyone's smiling and lively.

1339
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,150
Come here.

1340
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,700
This is where Hak grew up.

1341
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,860
ねね 城ってどんなとこなの

1342
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,950
Hey, what's the castle like?

1343
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,700
Do they have lots of good food?

1344
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,600
ご馳走いっぱいなのか

1345
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,330
Yes, but your food tastes better.

1346
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,930
うん だけどテヨンのご飯が一番美味しい

1347
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,940
お代わりあるから いっぱい食えよ

1348
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,000
There's more, so eat lots!

1349
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,630
Okay.

1350
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,510
Rina, did you sleep well last night?

1351
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,850
リナちゃん 昨日はよく眠れた

1352
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey, Rina!

1353
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,370
ちょっと リナちゃん

1354
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,260
Oh, yes.

1355
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,180
あ はい

1356
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,640
Right, I'm Rina.

1357
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,500
私の事か

1358
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
You're such an absent-minded girl.

1359
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,820
ぼっとした子だね

1360
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,650
I heard you were thrown out of the castle.

1361
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,560
あんた城追い出されたんだって

1362
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:18,190
They said you couldn't cook, sew, clean, do laundry, play the koto, or even dance.

1363
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:18,110
聞いたよ 料理も裁縫も掃除も洗濯も琴も舞も出来なかったって

1364
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Don't worry. I'll teach you everything from scratch.

1365
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,880
心配しなくていいよ あたしが一から教えてあげる

1366
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,040
First, wash these.

1367
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,970
まずこれ 洗っといて

1368
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,750
W-Wash them?

1369
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,660
あ 洗うって

1370
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
任せたよ

1371
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,080
I'll leave it to you.

1372
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,670
Um, I...

1373
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,590
あの...

1374
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,630
This way, my lady.

1375
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,730
こちだ 女官殿

1376
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,300
What is it?

1377
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,080
なんですか

1378
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,680
I can play the koto and dance a little.

1379
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,640
琴と舞はちょっとなら出来るわ

1380
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,180
Oh, right. That cacophony.

1381
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,200
あぁ あの不協和音ね

1382
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,230
You're a bit more like yourself.

1383
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,460
少し戻ってきたな

1384
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,850
Huh?

1385
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,310
Nothing.

1386
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,230
何でもありません

1387
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,400
So you have a younger brother.

1388
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,940
ハクに弟が居たのね

1389
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,990
He's cute. Nothing like you.

1390
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,740
可愛くて ハクに似てない

1391
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,400
Sorry about that.

1392
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,080
悪かったな

1393
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,700
テヨンは俺と同じ 爺ちゃんが拾ってきた子なんですよ

1394
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,320
Grandpa took Tae-yeon in, just like me.

1395
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,450
Unlike me, he's frail.

1396
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,010
俺と違って体が弱い

1397
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,250
That's why everyone's especially nice to him.

1398
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,020
だから特別皆が大事にしてるんです

1399
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,120
He got a bit too excited yesterday.

1400
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,070
昨日はちょっと燥ぎ過ぎてたな

1401
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,170
We're here. We wash clothes in that river.

1402
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,090
着きましたよ そこの川で洗濯するんです

1403
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,630
Its water is the Wind Tribe's life,
so be careful with-

1404
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,740
風の部族にとって命の水だから 大事に...

1405
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,050
Hak, I can't.

1406
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,990
ハク 出来ない

1407
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,930
You haven't done anything yet.

1408
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,850
あのな まだ何もしとらんだろが

1409
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,520
But...

1410
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,390
だって...

1411
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,480
The river has dried up.

1412
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,400
川が枯れてる

1413
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
川の水がない

1414
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,690
There's no water in the river.

1415
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,530
Calm down!

1416
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,450
落ち着け

1417
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,700
We're sending Hean-dea to check
on conditions upriver.

1418
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,440
今ヘンデを上流の調査に向かわせている

1419
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,120
Young lord, this isn't the time
to be so unconcerned!

1420
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,960
若長 そんな悠長な事言ってる場合かよ

1421
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,410
騒いだ所で事態は変わらねぇだろ

1422
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,410
Making a fuss won't fix anything.

1423
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,420
For now, we can buy water from the merchants.

1424
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,320
水は当分商団から買えばいい

1425
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,790
They should have enough reserves to see us through the current situation.

1426
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,710
当座を凌ぐくらいの蓄えはあるはずだ

1427
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,130
ムンドク長老が帰ってきた

1428
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,210
Elder Mun-deok has returned!

1429
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,880
Grandpa!

1430
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,430
Princess.

1431
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,340
姫様

1432
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,180
You're all right.

1433
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,100
ご無事だったか

1434
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,010
よかった

1435
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,100
Thank goodness.

1436
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,870
信じたくなかったが

1437
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,930
I didn't want to believe it,

1438
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,730
but when I heard the king was dead, and you'd left the castle with Hak...

1439
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,650
陛下が亡くなられてあんたとハクが城を去ったと聞き

1440
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you then.

1441
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,520
その時お守り出来ず 口惜しい

1442
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,070
Mun-deok...

1443
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,990
ムンドク...

1444
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,990
I can't breathe.

1445
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,700
苦しい

1446
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,080
Have you lost weight?

1447
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,970
少しお痩せになられましたが

1448
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,130
うん 暖かいもの 美味しいもの 沢山貰ったの

1449
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,210
No. I've been given many warm
and delicious things to eat.

1450
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,630
The Wind Tribe is like you, Mun-deok.

1451
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,110
風の部族はムンドクみたい

1452
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,260
暖かくてほっとする

1453
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,340
It's warm and reassuring here.

1454
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,380
Brother!

1455
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,060
兄ちゃん

1456
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,900
爺ちゃん

1457
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,050
Grandpa!

1458
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,400
ヘンデが戻ったぞ

1459
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,470
Hean-dea's back.

1460
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,600
Hean-dea, your injuries...

1461
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,350
ヘンデ その傷は

1462
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,390
What happened?

1463
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,540
何があった

1464
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,480
I messed up.

1465
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,380
いやいや ちょっと失敗しちゃって

1466
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,770
I went upriver, and would you believe it,

1467
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,700
上流に行ったらびっくり

1468
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,780
火の部族の奴らが川を塞き止めてたからさ

1469
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,860
some guys from the Fire Tribe were damming the flow.

1470
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,630
思わず武装した奴らに喧嘩売っちゃったのね

1471
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,740
I thoughtlessly picked a fight with them,
but they were armed.

1472
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,880
そしたらぼこぼこでぽいよ

1473
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,610
They beat the snot out of me.

1474
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,740
The Fire Tribe...

1475
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,800
火の部族

1476
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,870
What are they trying to do?

1477
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,630
奴ら何してくれちゃってんだ

1478
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,630
俺らと戦争でもやるのか

1479
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,490
Do they want a war with us?

1480
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,080
Lord Hak, let me go!

1481
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,170
ハク様 俺に行かせてください

1482
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
I'll beat them up.

1483
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,520
ぼこぼこにしてやる

1484
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,900
待って 火の部族に手を出してはならん

1485
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,960
Wait. You mustn't attack the Fire Tribe.

1486
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,710
Why? They stopped up the river
and tried to kill Hean-dea!

1487
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,630
何で 奴ら川を止めてヘンデを殺したいんっすよ

1488
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,930
このままだと風牙の都が...

1489
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,050
At this rate, Capital Fuuga will be...

1490
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,240
落ち着け 川の事なら心配いらん

1491
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,470
Calm down. Don't worry about the river.

1492
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,760
In any case, hurry up and treat Hean-dea.

1493
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,680
とにかくヘンデの治療を急げ

1494
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,570
はい

1495
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,850
Yes, sir.

1496
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,970
ほら 行くぞ

1497
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,770
Let's go.

1498
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,560
Wait! I'm still alive!

1499
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,980
Grandpa.

1500
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,380
これは火の部族の警告じゃ

1501
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,440
This is a warning from the Fire Tribe.

1502
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,900
A warning?

1503
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,340
警告

1504
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,400
They want to crown Lord Su-won king.

1505
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,650
奴らはスウォン様を王に即位させたがっている

1506
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,310
わしが王に承認せんから圧力をかけてきたんじゃろう

1507
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,370
They're pressuring us because I didn't approve.

1508
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,520
父上を殺したスウォンがこの国の王になる

1509
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,580
Su-won, who killed my father,
will be king of this country?

1510
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,040
姫様

1511
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,120
Princess.

1512
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,000
It's all right. I will never approve.

1513
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,930
大丈夫じゃ 承認はせぬ

1514
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,750
If I acknowledge Lord Su-won as king,

1515
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,680
スウォン様を王に認めてしまったら

1516
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,230
ハクに国王殺害の疑いがある事も認めてしまう事になる

1517
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,300
it would also mean acknowledging that Hak may have killed the king.

1518
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,550
だろうな 俺に罪を着せるのが一番手っ取り早い

1519
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,640
You're right. Blaming me would be the fastest way.

1520
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,930
ハク

1521
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,010
Hak...

1522
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,980
Don't worry.

1523
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,710
心配はいらん

1524
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,270
The Fire Tribe won't do anything worse than this.

1525
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,430
火の部族とて これ以上の無茶はせんじゃろう

1526
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,900
How is the Wind Tribe reacting?

1527
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,880
風の部族の様子はどうだ

1528
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
今の所 動きはないですね

1529
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,570
They haven't made a move yet.

1530
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,520
この分だと数日内に音をあげ...

1531
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,030
At this rate, we should see some
commotion in a few days-

1532
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,580
つめが甘いな 川を止めてそれで終わりか

1533
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,660
It isn't enough. Are we just damming the river?

1534
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,120
はい スジンからはその様に仰せつかってますが

1535
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,830
Yes. That's what General Su-jin ordered us to do.

1536
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,460
Merchants visit the Wind Tribe regularly.

1537
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,350
風の部族には定期的に商団が来るらしいな

1538
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,590
If they purchase water from the merchants, this will prove pointless.

1539
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,980
商団から水を買われては意味がない

1540
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,680
Crush them before they reach Capital Fuuga.

1541
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,860
風牙の都に着く前に潰せ

1542
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,180
But we shouldn't act without
General Su-jin's approval.

1543
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,120
しかし スジン将軍のお許しを得ずに勝手な事は...

1544
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,940
山賊か何かの仕業に見せかければいいだろう

1545
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,220
Make it look like the work of bandits!

1546
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,940
Why are you so upset, Lord Tae-jun?

1547
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,140
何をいらいらしてるんですか テジュン様

1548
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,440
If I had acquired Princess Yona,
the throne would've been mine.

1549
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,970
ヨナ姫を手に入れていれば
玉座は私のものだったのに

1550
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,690
If only Hak hadn't interfered!

1551
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,870
あの時ハクが邪魔しなければ

1552
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,200
Are you being serious?

1553
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,770
マジで言ってんの

1554
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,870
Su-won will ascend the throne.

1555
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,450
スウォンが即位する

1556
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,210
The other tribes approved.

1557
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,040
そして風以外の部族はそれを認めた

1558
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,290
What will happen to the Wind Tribe?

1559
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,150
風の部族はどうなるの

1560
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,920
Rina.

1561
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,380
リナ

1562
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,920
どうした お腹すいた

1563
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,050
What's wrong? Are you hungry?

1564
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,500
ご飯だぞ

1565
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,380
It's time for dinner.

1566
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,470
There's not enough water,
but you're giving me so much.

1567
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,460
水が不足してるのに 私ばかり

1568
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,750
大丈夫 リナを太らせてこいってハク兄ちゃんが...

1569
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,890
It's okay. Hak told me to fatten you up.

1570
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,710
それにお客様にはたんまりおもてなしして銭貰うのが

1571
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,690
Besides, Hak said it's the Wind Tribe's way to pamper guests,

1572
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,150
so they'll give us money.

1573
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,090
風の流儀だって...

1574
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,030
Tae-yeon?

1575
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,020
テヨン

1576
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,440
Tae-yeon?!

1577
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,640
テヨン

1578
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,240
What's wrong?

1579
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,560
どうした

1580
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,740
He suddenly collapsed!

1581
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,860
急に倒れて

1582
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,950
He's having a fit.

1583
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,380
発作じゃ

1584
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,580
Tae-yeon's lungs have always been weak.

1585
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,830
テヨンは昔から肺が悪くて 時折呼吸麻痺を起すんじゃ

1586
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,000
Sometimes, he gets respiratory paralysis.

1587
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,670
Once he takes his medicine, he'll be fine.

1588
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,620
なに 薬を飲めばすぐ...

1589
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,220
それが今日来るはずの商団がまだ来ねぇんだ

1590
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,290
But the merchants who were supposed to arrive today haven't come yet.

1591
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,670
I'll go check it out.

1592
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,590
俺 見てくる

1593
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,090
It's an emergency!

1594
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,020
大変だ

1595
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,920
The merchants were attacked on their way here!

1596
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,810
商団がここに来る途中 何者かに襲われた

1597
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,630
No!

1598
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,710
そんな

1599
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,640
They're all seriously injured.

1600
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,880
皆大けがを負ったって

1601
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,730
では水を手に入れる手段は絶たるだろか

1602
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,810
Then we've lost our means of acquiring water?

1603
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,310
The medicine...

1604
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,230
薬は...

1605
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,560
What about Tae-yeon's medicine?

1606
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,710
テヨンの薬は

1607
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,230
Damn it.

1608
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,790
クソ

1609
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,950
火の部族の仕業に決まってる

1610
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,810
This must be the Fire Tribe's work!

1611
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,940
I can't let this slide!

1612
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,980
もう許さん

1613
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,860
Young lord, why aren't you saying anything?

1614
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,070
若長 何黙ってんだよ

1615
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,490
This isn't like you, Elder.

1616
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,230
らしくないですよ 長老

1617
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,450
The royal family stands behind the Fire Tribe.

1618
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,710
火の部族の後ろには空 王族が居る

1619
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,830
If we antagonize them,
the Wind Tribe won't escape unscathed.

1620
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,640
敵に回せば 風の部族はただで済まされねぇ

1621
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,750
いや もう誰かが死ぬ所を見たくない

1622
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,830
No. I don't want to see anyone else die!

1623
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,040
Hean-dea, your injuries...

1624
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,020
ヘンデ お前けが...

1625
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,550
Okay, okay! Calm down, you hot-blooded idiots!

1626
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,460
はいはい 血の気の多いバカ共落ち着け

1627
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,300
You attacked them first.

1628
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,950
お前が先に特攻したんじゃねか

1629
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,140
The most important thing right now is Tae-yeon's medicine, isn't it?

1630
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,050
とりあえず今一番大事なのはテヨンの薬だろ

1631
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,680
I'll go to the doctor in the eastern forest and get some medicine.

1632
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,620
俺東森の医術師のとこ行って薬貰ってくるわ

1633
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,230
You'll go all the way there, despite your injuries?

1634
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,040
あんな所までそのけがでか

1635
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,980
I'm the fastest rider in the Wind Tribe.

1636
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,900
俺風の部族一速く馬を駆れるもん

1637
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,520
You okay with that, young lord?

1638
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,100
ね いいでしょう 若長

1639
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,940
Leave it to Hean-dea!

1640
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,860
ヘンデにお任せ

1641
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,000
薬代 値切れよ

1642
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Haggle down the price of the medicine.

1643
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,180
では

1644
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm off.

1645
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,410
He's so reckless.

1646
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,330
無茶しやがって

1647
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,890
てめえら 聞け

1648
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,950
Listen, everyone.

1649
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,540
I understand your rage,
but the Fire Tribe is strong.

1650
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,680
お前らの怒りは分かるが
火の部族は相当な兵力を持っている

1651
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,170
I won't let you start a war with them now.

1652
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,480
今戦争すんのは許さねぇ

1653
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,420
I promise I'll do something about this.

1654
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,420
この件は必ず俺が何とかする

1655
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,930
It's not like we'll shrivel up just because the river has run dry.

1656
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,280
川が止められたからって
すぐに干涸らびる俺らじゃなし

1657
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,760
Entrust your lives to me, and wait quietly.

1658
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,560
俺に命預けたと思って黙って待ってろ

1659
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,600
Those are the orders of Son Hak,
Chief of the Wind Tribe.

1660
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,460
風の部族長 ソンハクの命令だ

1661
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,690
Did you hear that?

1662
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,700
聞いたか

1663
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,230
The young lord gave us orders.

1664
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,510
若長が命令だ何て

1665
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,230
Lord Hak...

1666
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,150
The Lord Hak who said becoming
a general would be too much work!

1667
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,070
面倒くさがって将軍嫌がってたハク様が...

1668
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,780
His condition is improving.

1669
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,920
少し持ち直したな

1670
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,780
You should get some rest.
You'll collapse again.

1671
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,690
いい加減あんたも休め またぶっ倒れるぞ

1672
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,700
Hak, is there anything I can do?

1673
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,840
ハク あの...私には何かできる事...ない

1674
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,500
Well, a court lady should try to be a little sexier.

1675
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,410
そうだな 女官殿はもうちょっと色気を身につけるこったな

1676
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,460
Wha-

1677
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,050
Hak, I'm being serious here.

1678
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,530
ハクお前 私が真面目な話を...

1679
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,180
It's fine. You can live a carefree life here.

1680
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,100
いいんだよ あんたはここでのんびり暮らせば

1681
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,280
What's wrong? You can't sleep?

1682
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,200
どうした 眠れんのか

1683
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,160
What about you?

1684
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,260
長老様こそ

1685
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,290
Since neither of us can sleep,
why don't we have a drink?

1686
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,940
眠れない同士 一杯どうですか

1687
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,920
It's rare for you to offer me such good sake.

1688
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,840
珍しいな お前がわしにこんな良い酒を

1689
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,050
No. This is from your prized sake cellar.

1690
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,890
いや これはじじ秘蔵の酒蔵から...

1691
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,440
もったいねぇな

1692
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,680
What a waste.

1693
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,060
So... what do you want?

1694
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,870
で...何の用じゃ

1695
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,390
I've been thinking.

1696
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,220
ちょっと考え事

1697
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,440
If it were you alone,

1698
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,100
爺ちゃんがたった一人なら

1699
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,570
you probably would've charged into the castle with a single spear.

1700
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,760
槍一つ掲げて城に乗り込んだんだろなって

1701
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,650
You're one to talk.

1702
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,740
小僧が人の事言えるのか

1703
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,910
You're putting too much stress
on your body, old man.

1704
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,820
老体に色々背負い込みすぎだろ じじ

1705
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,110
頼みがある

1706
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,040
I have a request.

1707
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,860
スウォンの新王即位を承認してくれ

1708
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,000
I need you to approve of Su-won
becoming the new king.

1709
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,500
Tomorrow morning, I'm leaving the Wind Tribe.

1710
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,280
俺は明朝 風の部族を去る

1711
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,710
You can have the Son name back too.

1712
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,820
あんたにソンの名をお返しする

1713
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,610
あんたは風の部族を守る事だけ考えてくれ

1714
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,180
Think only of protecting the Wind Tribe.

1715
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,580
承認すれば火の部族も手出しはしないはずだ

1716
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,640
Once you approve, the Fire Tribe should stop bothering you.

1717
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,390
You may end up with a bounty on your head.

1718
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,310
賞金首にでもされるかもしれんぞ

1719
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,400
That sounds cool. Maybe I'll become Kouka's greatest villain.

1720
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,560
いいね 高華一の悪党にでもなるか

1721
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,850
姫様は置いてゆく気か

1722
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,730
Are you leaving the princess behind?

1723
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,780
She's finally able to smile a little again.

1724
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,880
ようやく少し笑える様になってきた

1725
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,370
連れてきてよかったと思ってる

1726
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,450
I'm glad I brought her here.

1727
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,800
頼みはもう一つ

1728
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,870
I have another favor to ask of you.

1729
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,560
ヨナ姫を城から隠し

1730
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,580
Hide Princess Yona from the castle,

1731
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,580
一生ここで風の部族の人間として生かしてやってくれ

1732
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,580
and let her live her whole life
as a member of the Wind Tribe!

1733
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,130
No.

1734
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:18,940
嫌じゃ

1735
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,550
I refuse to take requests from my grandson.

1736
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,500
孫のお願いなんじゃ わしは聞かん

1737
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,930
わしはお前を手放したりせんぞ

1738
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,720
I won't let you go.

1739
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,890
Old man...

1740
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,740
部族長の命なら 従わん訳にもいかんが

1741
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,720
Though I suppose I can't
disobey my chief's orders.

1742
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,000
風の部族長ソンハク 最後の命令だ

1743
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,980
Those are the final orders of Son Hak,
Chief of the Wind Tribe.

1744
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,810
As you wish.

1745
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,840
御意

1746
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,760
Do you see

1747
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,760
Do you see

1748
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,760
wakaru kai

1749
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,760
wakaru kai

1750
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:20,360
What I'm trying so hard to convey through my work?

1751
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:20,360
What I'm trying so hard to convey through my work?

1752
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:20,360
muriyari demo sakuhin de tsutaetokitai koto wo

1753
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:20,360
muriyari demo sakuhin de tsutaetokitai koto wo

1754
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,110
It's always been this way, hasn't it?

1755
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,110
It's always been this way, hasn't it?

1756
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,110
mukashi to kawaranai daro

1757
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,110
mukashi to kawaranai daro

1758
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,910
