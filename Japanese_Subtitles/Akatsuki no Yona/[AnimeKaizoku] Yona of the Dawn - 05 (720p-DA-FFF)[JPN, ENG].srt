ちょうど良かった これ運んでくれ

261
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,230
Really, those Fire Tribe men are out of control.

262
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,550
まったく 火の部族の奴らめちゃくちゃやるんだから

263
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,710
中はけが人だらけだよ

264
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,890
Lots of injured people in there.

265
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,180
火の部族に襲われた商団の人達

266
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,280
The merchants that were attacked by the Fire Tribe...

267
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,080
Why did this happen?

268
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,980
どうしてこんな事に

269
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,580
What have we done to deserve this?

270
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,390
私らが何をしたって言うんだい

271
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,420
As long as you're alive, things will work out.

272
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,830
生きてりゃ何とでもなるっさ

273
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,060
いざとなったらあたしが世話してやるから

274
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,500
If it comes to it, I'll take care of you.

275
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,510
Whoops.

276
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
ごめんリナさん ふらついちゃって

277
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,300
Sorry, Rina. I'm a little unsteady.

278
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,760
Rina?

279
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,660
リナさん

280
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,640
The Fire Tribe would go this far
to put Su-won on the throne?

281
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,540
火の部族はスウォンを即位させる為にここまでするの

282
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,270
This absurdity is permissible?

283
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,170
こんな不条理が許されるの

284
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Can you...

285
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,130
あなたは あなたは許せるの スウォン

286
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,650
Can you allow this, Su-won?

287
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,450
It's all right!

288
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,050
大丈夫

289
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,700
We'll be fine with the young lord
and the elder around.

290
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,400
若長や長老が居る限りね

291
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,160
Despite how they seem,
they look out for their family.

292
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,750
あの人達 ああ見えて家族思いだから

293
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,910
Family...

294
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,020
家族...

295
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,960
Yeah! Everyone in the Wind Tribe is family.

296
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,700
そう 風の部族の皆は家族なのです

297
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,790
So you're part of our family now too.

298
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,630
だからリナさんも もう俺らの家族なのです

299
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,460
Huh?

300
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,240
泣かせたな ヘンデ

301
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,340
Aw, you made her cry, Hean-dea.

302
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,120
ハク様に殺される

303
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Lord Hak's gonna kill me!

304
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,730
ハクやムンドク 優しい風の部族の人達

305
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,730
Hak and Mun-deok. The kind people of the Wind Tribe.

306
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,980
They must be feeling such terrible pain and intense rage.

307
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,780
強い痛みもあるだろ 激しい怒りもあるだろ

308
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,350
胸に締まって笑う 誇り高い風

309
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,450
The proud wind hides these feelings within and smiles.

310
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,320
Huh?

311
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,200
Rina, are you all right?

312
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,420
リナさん 大丈夫

313
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,700
I can't let these people get caught up in this.

314
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,370
この人達を巻き込んではダメ

315
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,860
ハク

316
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,590
Hak...

317
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,730
テヨン

318
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
Tae-yeon?

319
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
リナ

320
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,060
Rina...

321
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,590
今のは ハク

322
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,480
Was that Hak?

323
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,270
Yeah.

324
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,970
リナはどうしたの

325
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,070
What is it, Rina?

326
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,360
I wanted to thank you.

327
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,290
お礼を言いたいの

328
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,570
Thank me?

329
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,210
お礼？

330
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,920
You gave me good food, wiped away my tears, and cheered me up.

331
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:58,790
あったかいご飯をくれて涙を拭ってくれて元気くれて

332
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,320
ありがとう

333
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,420
Thank you.

334
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,200
お世話になりました

335
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,300
Thank you for everything.

336
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,260
I thought you were going to stay here forever.

337
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,230
リナはずっとここに居るんだと思ってた

338
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,210
なんだ

339
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,310
Oh, well...

340
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,460
なんだ

341
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,560
Oh, well...

342
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,300
死にたいと思った夜もあったけど

343
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,400
Some nights, I wanted to die.

344
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,120
この小さな体で

345
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,030
But with this small body,

346
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,330
苦しさなんか微塵も感じさせない笑顔と強さが

347
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,660
with his strength and smiles that never showed the slightest sign of pain,

348
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,460
私に勇気をくれたの

349
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,540
he gave me courage.

350
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,420
私 忘れない テヨンとここの人達を

351
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,500
I won't forget you or the people who live here.

352
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,010
Stay well, and take care.

353
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,910
体を大切に 元気で

354
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,410
ごめんなさい ハク兄ちゃん

355
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm sorry, Hak.

356
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,960
リナを守るって約束したばかりなのに

357
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,060
I just promised I would protect Rina...

358
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,980
守れそうにないや

359
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,070
but I don't think I'll be able to.

360
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,220
今日はまともに門番してるみたいだな

361
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,330
Looks like you're actually keeping watch today.

362
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,330
背中を預ける奴が居ないと眠れねぇんで

363
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,290
I can't sleep without someone at my back.

364
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,630
寝るな

365
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,870
Don't sleep.

366
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,170
Where are you going, Lord Hak?

367
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,630
ハク様はどちらへ

368
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm leaving.

369
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,920
俺 ここを出るわ

370
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,670
Really? See you later.

371
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,540
あぁ いってらっしゃい

372
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,800
Seriously?

373
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,640
マジで

374
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,680
That means you're the Wind Tribe's next chief.

375
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,620
つぅ訳で 次期風の部族長はお前な

376
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,510
No way! It's too much work!

377
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,270
嫌だよ面倒くさい

378
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,180
Wait, are you leaving Rina behind?

379
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,980
て言うか リナさんを置いてつもり

380
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,060
I thought about seeing her before I left, but...

381
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,960
最後くらい 顔を見ようかと思ったけどな

382
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,670
あいつも纏めて頼むわ

383
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,150
Take care of her too.

384
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,740
Princesses with baggage are a heavy burden.

385
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,940
訳ありのお姫様何て 荷が重いっすよ

386
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,280
You knew?

387
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,170
お前 気づいて...

388
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,870
Hak!

389
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,800
ハク

390
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm leaving this place.

391
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,130
私 ここを出る

392
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,420
Come with me!

393
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,320
一緒に来なさい

394
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,330
なんだって

395
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,460
What did you say?

396
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,840
ここを出るの

397
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,010
I'm leaving.

398
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,830
ここに居たら風牙の都を争いに巻き込んでしまう

399
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,930
If I stay here, Capital Fuuga will
be caught up in the conflict.

400
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,880
帰れ

401
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,550
Go back.

402
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,010
I've already spoken to the elder.

403
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,170
長老にはその旨 伝えてある

404
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,200
もうここは大丈夫だ

405
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,140
This place is safe now.

406
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,810
You should live here quietly.

407
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,630
あんたはここで静かに暮らせ

408
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,210
お前が一人で行くの 許した覚えはないわ

409
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,320
I don't remember allowing you to leave alone.

410
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,950
You told me to use you as a tool to live.

411
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,850
私が生きる為に自分を使えとハクは言ってくれたじゃない

412
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,370
I've returned the name of "Son."

413
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,730
俺はソンの名を返した

414
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,950
I'm no longer a general or your servant.

415
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,010
もう将軍でもなければあんたの従者でもない

416
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,210
I'm about to leave on a free journey.

417
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,540
これから自由の旅に出ようってのに

418
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,460
I don't have to take care of you.

419
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,360
あんたの面倒まで見る義理ねぇな

420
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,380
If you keep quiet, Su-won won't do anything.

421
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,280
あんたが静かにしてればスウォンも手出しはしない

422
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,800
Move.

423
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,830
退け

424
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,510
I've already decided!

425
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
もう決めたの

426
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,760
No matter what you think,
I'm not taking you with me.

427
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,660
どう思おうが俺は連れて行かない

428
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,360
金はあるのか

429
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,980
Do you have money?

430
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,150
If we're going to be traveling together, I'll have to protect you.

431
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,190
これから先 一緒に行くなら
どうしたって俺はあんたを守らなきゃならない

432
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,160
I'm asking if you have the money
to pay for my services.

433
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,850
今のあんたに俺の働きに見合う金を払う事が出来るかって聞いてんだよ

434
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,160
Or will you pay with your body?

435
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,820
それとも 体で払うか

436
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,660
I don't have anything to give you.

437
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,670
あげられる物何て 何もないわ

438
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,540
You catch on quick.

439
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,630
物分りがいいな

440
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,670
Now, go.

441
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,690
さ 戻れ

442
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,920
Goodbye, Princess Yona.

443
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,810
さよなら ヨナ姫

444
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,260
But I want you!

445
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,260
でも お前が欲しいもの

446
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,640
Give yourself to me, Hak!

447
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,540
私にハクを頂戴

448
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,740
なんだ そりゃ

449
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,020
What are you talking about?

450
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,300
やっぱ すげぇ我がまま

451
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,310
You're so willful.

452
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,980
あぁくそぉむかつく

453
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,860
Damn it. It's so annoying.

454
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,670
これだから

455
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,780
This is why...

456
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,330
You win, Princess.

457
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,220
あんたの勝ちです 姫様

458
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,420
Hak...

459
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,970
ハク

460
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,420
Old man!

461
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,920
Call me "Grandpa"!

462
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,090
爺さんと呼べ

463
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,590
Were you there the whole time?

464
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,500
ずっとそこに

465
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,760
I heard you being rude to the princess!

466
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,330
さっきから聞いていれば姫様に対する暴言の数々

467
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,050
Mun-deok...

468
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,750
ムンドク

469
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,600
It seems I must let another grandchild go.

470
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,300
孫をまた一人 手放すようじゃ

471
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,190
Everyone told me...

472
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,090
私 皆にも言われたの

473
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,440
that I was family.

474
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,510
家族だって

475
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,230
It made me happy.

476
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,280
嬉しかった

477
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,480
だから出ていくの

478
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,610
That's why I'm leaving.

479
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,950
Mun-deok, please protect the Wind Tribe.

480
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,710
ムンドク どうか風の部族を守って

481
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,080
Don't forget, Princess.

482
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,460
忘れないでくだされ 姫様

483
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,710
いつかあなたが再び絶望に立たされ 助けを求めた時

484
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,960
If you ever lose hope again and need assistance,

485
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,330
我ら風の部族は誰を敵に回してもお味方致します

486
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,970
the Wind Tribe will always be by your side, no matter who stands against us,

487
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,280
どんなに遠く離れても

488
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,390
nor how far away you may be.

489
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,850
Lord Kang Tae-jun.

490
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,350
カンテジュン様

491
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,840
後にしろ しょんぼり中だ

492
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,310
Tell me later. I'm miserable.

493
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,910
はい

494
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,020
What?

495
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,900
My father scolded me.

496
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,770
父上に怒られたのだ

497
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,490
勝手に行動するなと

498
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,730
He told me not to act without permission.

499
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,800
そんなテジュン様に朗報ですよ

500
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,900
I have good news for you, Lord Tae-jun.

501
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,610
Huh?

502
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,780
風牙の都付近でヨナ姫を見たとの情報が

503
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,820
Princess Yona was spotted near Capital Fuuga.

504
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,800
なに

505
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,320
What?

506
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,110
赤い髪の少女を兵が確認しました

507
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,200
A soldier saw a girl with red hair.

508
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,710
側にはハク将軍も居て二人はその後北山の方へ向かったとか

509
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,460
General Hak was also with her.

510
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,880
The two of them were heading toward the northern mountains.

511
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,150
北山だと

512
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,960
The northern mountains?

513
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,240
あの様ななにもない所へ なぜ

514
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,340
Why would they go to such a desolate place?

515
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,630
Who knows?

516
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,480
あの男も一緒なのだな

517
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,340
So that man is with her, then?

518
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,200
巡ってきた

519
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,010
My luck has turned.

520
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,000
兵を集めろ

521
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,470
Gather the soldiers!

522
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,080
ヨナ姫を捉えるぞ

523
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,510
We'll capture Princess Yona!

524
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,910
何か見えた

525
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,060
Do you see anything?

526
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,130
皆無

527
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,770
No.

528
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,400
あのじじ

529
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,900
How does the old man expect us to find someone, when we don't know where he is?

530
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,570
何処に居るのか分からん奴を探せっつってもな

531
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,860
神官？

532
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,940
A priest?

533
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,950
そう

534
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,950
Yes.

535
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,420
古より

536
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,080
Since ancient times, a priest who has seen the Kingdom of Kouka's future

537
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,750
この高華国の未来を見据えてきた神官様が
風の地のどこかにおられると言う

538
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,000
has been said to live somewhere
within the Wind Tribe's territory.

539
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:17,170
If you're not certain what to do next, you should seek out the priest.

540
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:17,070
姫様がこれからどうすべきかを迷っておられるなら
神官様のもとへ行きなされ

541
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm sure he will show you the way.

542
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,080
きっと道を示して下さる

543
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,680
Long ago, the priest lived in
a temple at the royal palace

544
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:28,400
昔から 神官は王宮の神殿に住まい
国の政に大きく関わっていたと聞く

545
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,680
and was deeply involved in the kingdom's governance.

546
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,890
ユホン様が神官を弾圧してからは

547
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,310
After Yu-hon began oppressing the priest, he left the castle.

548
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:37,080
城を出て今は人里離れた場所にひっそりと暮らしているんだと

549
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,980
Now he lives quietly, somewhere far from people.

550
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,530
Far from people.

551
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,770
人里を離れた

552
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,570
This certainly doesn't seem like somewhere a person could live.

553
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,710
確かに誰も住めそうにない場所

554
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,280
If you tried living here, you might fall off a cliff.

555
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,480
まぁ 姫さんが住んだら
即 崖から転がり落ちるかもしれんが

556
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,620
But I'm sure a person could do it if he really tried.

557
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,520
その気になりゃ 何とか住めるだろう

558
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,920
Even though I called myself the princess of the kingdom, I only knew Hiryuu Castle.

559
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,720
私はこの国の姫を名乗っていたのに
知っているのは緋龍城だけ

560
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,550
It sounds foolish to say I don't know.

561
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,250
知らない 何て愚かな響き

562
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,840
What path should I follow now?

563
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,740
私の行くべき道か

564
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,520
今は生きるだけで精一杯だ

565
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,060
At this moment, just trying to live
is taking everything I have.

566
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,600
By the way, Princess,

567
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,110
ところでお姫様

568
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,270
if we must search every corner of this area,
we'll have to sleep outside.

569
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,170
この辺を虱潰しに探すとなると野宿になるが どうします

570
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,610
What should we do?

571
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,190
Sleep outside? I've gotten a bit used to it.

572
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,090
野宿 少しは慣れたわ

573
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,950
Unlike the mountains behind the castle,
it gets cold here.

574
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,730
城の裏山と違ってここは冷えますよ

575
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,490
Then I'll snuggle against you while I sleep.

576
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,330
その時はハクに包まって寝るから

577
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,280
Whoosh

578
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,280

I don't mind,

649
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,260
いいけど

650
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,670
but I'll play pranks on you.

651
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,220
いたずらしますよ

652
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,330
Pranks?

653
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,690
いたずら

654
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,550
Pranks are...

655
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,490
いたずらって言うのは

656
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,670
things like this.

657
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,570
こう言う事とか

658
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,980
ハク ちょっと なにすっ...

659
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,140
Hak, what are you-

660
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,740
静かに

661
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,930
Quiet.

662
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,550
Footsteps.

663
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,630
四十...いや 五十か

664
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,430
Forty. No, fifty.

665
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,390
Pursuers?

666
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,410
追手

667
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,900
I thought they weren't chasing us anymore.

668
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,800
もう追う気がねぇのかと思ってたけど

669
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,690
That's quite a lot of people too.

670
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,030
こりゃまた気合の入った数だな

671
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,860
Are they the king's men?

672
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,930
王の兵

673
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,860
Or-

674
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,860
それとも

675
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,860
Princess,

676
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,000
姫様

677
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,150
やっぱ包まって寝るんなら もうちょい抱き心地よくねと

678
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,070
if we're going to be snuggling in our sleep,

679
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,370
I won't feel like playing pranks on you
if you're not a bit more comfortable to hold.

680
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,280
もうちょい抱き心地よくねと
いたずらする気も起きないですよ

681
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,500

682
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,120

Now, then.

805
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,900
準備運動もしましたし

806
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,090
I'm all warmed up.

807
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,130
Time to get to work.

808
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,200
働きましょうか

809
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,080
離れないで下さいよ お姫様

810
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,180
Stay close, Princess.

811
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,990
He truly is a Thunder Beast.

812
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,150
まさに雷獣

813
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,270
スウォンがいつか言っていた

814
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,370
Su-won once said...

815
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,580
Hak's techniques are like lightning.

816
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,970
ハクの技は稲妻みたいなんです

817
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,130
If we fought in earnest, I'm sure he would destroy me.

818
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,420
本気で戦えば 私はきっとコテンコテンですよ

819
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,930
Even in these moments,
I still remember your face so naturally.

820
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,820
こんな時に まだあ素直にあなたの顔を思い出す

821
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,260
どうした

822
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,020
What's wrong?

823
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,860
これで終わりか

824
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,690
Are you finished?

825
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,060
雷獣は健在だな

826
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,070
I see the Thunder Beast is going strong.

827
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,450
やっぱりあんたか

828
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,490
So it is you.

829
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,250
この時を待ちわびていましたよ

830
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,280
I've been waiting for this moment,

831
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,940
ソンハク将軍

832
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,080
General Son Hak...

833
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,190
そしてヨナ姫

834
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,290
and Princess Yona.

835
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,150
火の部族 このカンテジュンが...

836
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,830
I, Kang Tae-jun, of the Fire Tribe...

837
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,470
見てください姫様 自然がいっぱいだ

838
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,800
Look, Princess. There's nature everywhere.

839
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,750
What?!

840
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,090
Why are you enjoying nature
while I'm talking to you?

841
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,910
なぜ私が話しかけてる最中に自然を満喫するのだ

842
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,010
Oh, you were talking to me?

843
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,210
おう なんだ 俺に話しかけてたのか

844
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,020
I'm neither a general nor a "Son" now.

845
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,140
俺は今将軍でもソンでもないんで

846
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,390
Sorry about that.

847
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,300
すみませんね どうも

848
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,860
It's fine, as long as you understand.

849
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,260
あいや そんな 分かって貰えばよいのだ

850
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,650
Wait, what? You're not a general?

851
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,560
って何 将軍ではない

852
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,650
That's right. I'm just wandering traveler Hak.

853
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,420
ですよ 俺はただの流離の旅人ハク

854
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,650
That means...

855
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,770
つぅ訳で

856
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,290
whatever I do now has nothing
to do with the Wind Tribe.

857
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,940
俺がこれから何をしても
風の部族はなんら関係ございませんので

858
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,460
So that's it.

859
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,990
そう言う事か

860
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,580
Well, either way, I don't care about the Wind Tribe.

861
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,410
でもまぁ風の部族はどうでもよい
邪魔者は消えて貰うのみ

862
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,790
I will make those who stand in my way disappear.

863
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,590
I have business with Princess Yona!

864
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,490
そこに居るヨナ姫に用があるのでな

865
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,400
休む間を与えるな

866
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,140
Don't let him rest!

867
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,170
止めろ 奴を止めろ

868
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,270
Stop him! Stop him!

869
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,020
Archers, fire!

870
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,760
矢を放て

871
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,630
姫さん 太ったな

872
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,740
You've gained weight, Princess.

873
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,040
一言多い

874
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,150
That was unnecessary!

875
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,850
走るぞ

876
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,950
We're gonna run.

877
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,370
After them!

878
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,170
I'm scared. There are arrows and
soldiers closing in from all sides.

879
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,070
怖い 四方から矢と兵が押し寄せて

880
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,920
Not even Hak can handle all of these.

881
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,700
いくらハクでもこんなに

882
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,360
姫を狙え

883
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,260
Aim for the princess!

884
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,600
ハク

885
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,020
Hak!

886
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,850
Hak, are you all right?

887
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,490
ハク 大丈夫

888
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,600
Hak...

889
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,840
ハク

890
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,780
Don't worry about me. It's creepy.

891
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,630
心配なんてしないでくださいよ 気持ち悪い

892
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,950
Why, you-

893
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,700
お前は...

894
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,310
すげぇ

895
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,370
Amazing.

896
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,910
Don't stand around impressed!

897
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,400
感心するな

898
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,130
He's injured! After him!

899
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,050
奴は手負いだ 追え

900
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,800
We haven't found them yet.

901
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,830
まだ見つてません

902
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,710
What about over there?

903
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,630
そっちはどうだ

904
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,490
いない

905
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,590
They're not here!

906
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,970
Don't move, no matter what.

907
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
絶対に動かないでくださいよ

908
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,090
Hak, you're bleeding.

909
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,510
ハク お前 血が...

910
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,430
It isn't mine.

911
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,330
返り血ですよ

912
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,850
But...

913
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,430
そんな 待って ハク

914
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,470
Wait, Hak.

915
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:13,070
If we're going to be traveling together,
I'll have to protect you.

916
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,720
一緒に行くなら どうしたっても
俺はあんたを守らなきゃならない

917
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,930
私を庇って...

918
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,900
To protect me, you...

919
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,370
Where's the princess? Where did Princess Yona disappear to?

920
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,150
姫は ヨナ姫どこに消えたのだ

921
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,490
Kang Tae-jun...

922
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,850
カンテジュン

923
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,000
Hak apparently helped her escape.

924
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,760
ハクがどこかに逃がしたようですね

925
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,710
Find her!

926
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,620
必ず見つけ出せ

927
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,500
The Thunder Beast is human too.

928
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,280
雷獣も人の子よ

929
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,260
He seems to be tiring.

930
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,010
さすがに疲れが見えてきた様だな

931
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,470
先程当てた矢は毒矢です

932
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,380
The arrow that hit him was poisoned.

933
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,190
何 それを姫に向けたのか

934
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,010
What?

935
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,800
You fired poisoned arrows at the princess?

936
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,850
I knew Hak would shield the princess with his body if we fired at her.

937
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,100
向ければハクは体を張ってでも
矢を止めると確信がありましたから

938
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,100
An ordinary person wouldn't be able to move.

939
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,540
常人であればまず動けません

940
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,700
恐ろしい男です

941
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,810
He's a terrifying man.

942
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,930
ならば 次に背中を向けた時を狙え

943
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,860
Then when he turns his back, fire at him.

944
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,750
ハクが殺される

945
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,070
They're going to kill Hak?

946
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,350
絶対に動かないで下さいよ

947
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,450
Don't move, no matter what.

948
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,700
That's right.

949
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,110
そうだ

950
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,940
私が出て行っても 反って足を引っ張る

951
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,040
If I reveal myself, I'll only slow him down.

952
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,680
大丈夫よ

953
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,670
It'll be fine.

954
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,170
Hak is so strong.

955
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,190
ハクはあんなに強いんだもの

956
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,770
ハクなら...ハクなら矢くらい避けられる

957
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,670
Hak... Hak can dodge an arrow.

958
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,320
ここで大人しくしてハクが来るのを待とう

959
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,390
I should quietly wait here for Hak to come.

960
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,990
ハクは死んだりなんか...

961
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,060
Hak won't die.

962
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,520
No. Why did I leave Capital Fuuga?

963
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,740
違う 私は何のために風牙の都を出たの

964
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,190
So I could live in hiding, under Hak's protection?

965
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,400
ハクに守られてこそこそ生きるため？

966
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,110
If that's the case, I should've stayed in Capital Fuuga.

967
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,350
それなら風牙の都に居ればよかったんだ

968
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm just a burden to Hak.

969
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,320
これではハクの足枷になるだけ

970
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,580
I'm sure the priest will show you the way.

971
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,480
神官様がこれからの道をきっと示して下さる

972
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,580
Before I question the gods,

973
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,390
神に問う前に 自分に問う事があるはずよ

974
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,460
there are questions I should ask myself!

975
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,240
ヨ...ナ

976
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,560
Yona...

977
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,600
Wh-What is this?

978
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,580
なんだ

979
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,530
ヨナ姫

980
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,690
Princess Yona...

981
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,320
I never thought you'd come to me yourself.

982
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,020
まさか そちらから来られるとは

983
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,820
お話をしたいと思っていたのですよ

984
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,530
I wanted to speak to you.

985
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,910
There's no need to be so cautious.

986
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,330
そんなに警戒しないで

987
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,950
I came to get you.

988
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,470
私はあなたをお迎えに来たのです

989
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,850
迎え？

990
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,950
Get me?

991
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,460
Tomorrow morning, Lord Su-won will be crowned as the new king.

992
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,640
明朝 スウォン様が新王に即位されます

993
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,710
Poor princess...

994
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,940
お可哀想に 姫様

995
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,090
It must have been painful, losing the king and being chased from the castle.

996
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,980
陛下をなくされ 城を追われるなど身を切られる思いでしょう

997
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,300
Come with me, and we'll make this known.

998
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,710
私と来て この件を公表すれば

999
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,020
あなたを追い出した憎きスウォンを玉座から引きずり降ろし

1000
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,560
We can drag the detestable Su-won, who chased you from the castle,

1001
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,370
陛下の敵を討つ事が出来ます

1002
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,640
off the throne and avenge the king.

1003
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,520
なぜ動いた

1004
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,610
Why did you move?

1005
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,800
ですから姫 私と...

1006
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,940
So, Princess, come with me-

1007
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,480
そこまで知っていて なぜ風の部族に圧力をかけたの

1008
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,610
If you knew that, why did the Fire Tribe put pressure on the Wind Tribe?

1009
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,110
Huh?

1010
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,610
いや あれは父上の指示で私の意志では...

1011
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,740
Those were my father's orders.
It wasn't my idea.

1012
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,620
なぜ商団まで襲ったの

1013
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,040
Why did you attack the merchants?

1014
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,910
真実を知っているのなら

1015
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,290
If you know the truth, then instead of driving the Wind Tribe into a corner,

1016
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,950
風の部族を追い詰める前に 罪のないハクを殺す前に

1017
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,380
instead of trying to kill the innocent Hak,

1018
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,130
お前のすべき事があるはずだ

1019
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,130
there's something else you should be doing!

1020
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,110
燃える様な瞳

1021
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,220
Those burning eyes.

1022
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,750
なぜだ 目が逸らせない

1023
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,890
Why? I can't look away.

1024
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,350
私は何も知らない姫だが

1025
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,930
I may be an ignorant princess,

1026
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:37,150
but I'm not desperate enough to listen to someone who doesn't understand reason!

1027
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,170
道理も分からぬ者の言葉に耳を貸す程 落ちぶれではいない

1028
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,240
姫

1029
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,940
Princess!

1030
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,450
The red hair of what should have
been the young, weak princess...

1031
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:51,520
幼くて弱いはずの姫の赤い髪が己を焼き尽くす炎に見えた

1032
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,120
appeared to be a flame consuming her.

1033
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,770
Do you see

1034
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,770
Do you see

1035
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,770
wakaru kai

1036
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,770
wakaru kai

1037
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:23,360
What I'm trying so hard to convey through my work?

1038
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:23,360
What I'm trying so hard to convey through my work?

1039
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:23,360
muriyari demo sakuhin de tsutaetokitai koto wo

1040
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:23,360
muriyari demo sakuhin de tsutaetokitai koto wo

1041
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:30,120
It's always been this way, hasn't it?

1042
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:30,120
It's always been this way, hasn't it?

1043
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:30,120
mukashi to kawaranai daro

1044
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:30,120

1045
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,910
The same obscure lyrics and background

1046
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,910
The same obscure lyrics and background

1047
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,910

1048
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,910

1049
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,580
I've always talked ideals

1050
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,580
I've always talked ideals

1051
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,580
sasaeru da to ga erasou ni sa

1052
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,580
sasaeru da to ga erasou ni sa

1053
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,510
Like supporting others

1054
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,510
Like supporting others

1055
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,510

I hope you don't realize too early

1058
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,890
I hope you don't realize too early

1059

kotoba no karusa omoishiru no wa

1060
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,890
kotoba no karusa omoishiru no wa

1061
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,600
How irresponsible I was being with my words

1062
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,600
How irresponsible I was being with my words

1063
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,600

1064
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,600

1065
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,270
There's a reason why the snow is so cold

1066
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,270
There's a reason why the snow is so cold

1067

1069
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,990
Since my hands are warmer than others'

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,990
Since my hands are warmer than others'

1071
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,990
