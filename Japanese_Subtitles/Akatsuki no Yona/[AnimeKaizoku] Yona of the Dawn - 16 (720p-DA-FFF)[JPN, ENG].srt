見てくださいグンテ将軍

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,360
Look, General Geun-tae.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,940
That dance is very interesting.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,060
あの踊り 面白いですね

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,300
陛下

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,280
My king...

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,740
確か 俺は模擬選に出るはずですが

9
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,820
I believe I'm supposed to appear in the mock battle.

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,190
なんですか このひらひらした服は

11
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,950
So what are these frilly clothes?

12
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,460
お祭りの衣装ですよ

13
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,580
They're festival clothes.

14
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,140
今日はグンテ将軍が主役ですし

15
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,710
You're the star today, General Geun-tae.

16
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,120
綺麗ですよね

17
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,210
Aren't they beautiful?

18
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,210
異国の衣装見たい

19
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,630
They look foreign!

20
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,430
とても戦闘に向いてる服とは思えん

21
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,380
These clothes aren't suited for battle.

22
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,180
Especially these stones! They're in the way.

23
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,190
特にこの石 邪魔だ

24
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,840
Lord Geun-tae!

25
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,400
グンテ様

26
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,790
ユウノ

27
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,100
Yuno...

28
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,350
What should I do?

29
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,720
どうしよう

30
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,350
Blush

31
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,350
Blush

32
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,350
Blush

33
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,350
Blush

34
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,450
すごくすごくすごく可愛い

35
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,430
You look really cute!

36
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,900
You'd better not grab me and call me cute.

37
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,880
お前 俺をつかまえて 可愛いとか言うな

38
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,780
その衣装 私が見立てたの

39
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,940
I chose that outfit for you.

40
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,690
It was you?!

41
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,980
お前か

42
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,240
Damn you.

43
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,660
Oh, my.

44
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,830
陛下 これは妻のユウノ

45
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,870
King, this is my wife, Yuno.

46
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,680
ユウノさん こんにちは

47
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,700
Lady Yuno, hello.

48
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,690
まぁ 陛下も可愛い

49
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,660
You look cute too.

50
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,290
How do you know him?!

51
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,280
なんで知り合いだ

52
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,460
陛下は私のお茶を気に入って下さったの

53
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,540
The king said he likes my tea.

54
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,000
もうすっかりお茶飲み友たちよ

55
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,670
We're tea buddies now.

56
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,130
Right?

57
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,130
ね

58
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,550
When did this happen?

59
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,300
知らぬ間に

60
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,400
ね

61
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,510
Right.

62
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,100
グンテ様がこの一週間
陛下をほったらかしにしてたからですよ

63
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,800
It's your fault for ignoring the king all week, Lord Geun-tae.

64
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,890
The sound of festival music.

65
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,020
The voices of my tribe.

66
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,060
War games of a people who have forgotten what war is, in a time when black shadows loom over the kingdom.

67
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,120
黒い影 忍び寄る国の

68
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,360
戦争を忘れた人々の戦争ごっこ

69
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,960
こんなことをしている場合か

70
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,940
This isn't the time for these things.

71
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,370
O maiden!

72
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,370

73
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,250

75
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,890

This is meant to be a competition, but can the king even fight?

陛下の幼馴染であった雷獣 あいつは天才だった

1136
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,330
The Thunder Beast, the king's childhood friend, was a prodigy.

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,320
武人は実践において経験を積み 力を磨いてゆくのだが

1138

1140

but he possessed the strength of a thousand men, without ever truly going to war.

1141
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,600
だが陛下の武術の腕は噂にも聞かん

1142
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,180
However, I haven't even heard rumors of the king's combat prowess.

1143
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,760
見たところ 色も白く腕も細い

1144
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,770
He's pale, and his arms are thin.

1145
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,440
雷獣が虎なら 陛下はさながらウサギだな

1146
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,140
If the Thunder Beast is a tiger, then the king is a rabbit.

1147
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,770
誰か貴様などと意見が合うか

1148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,810

1149
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,980

1150
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,240

1151
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,650
Are you so blinded by natural talent?

1152
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,700
天賦の才がそんなに輝かしいか

1153
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,040
大地を引き裂く勢いで現れた虎ばかりに目を奪われ

1154
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,660
You're dazzled by the tiger's earth-shattering appearance,

1155
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,820
お前が言うウサギが本当はどんな姿をしているかも分からんとは

1156
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,040
and you fail to see the true nature of the so-called rabbit.

西門 舞いおりた美しき天の使い

1175
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,610
At the western gate is a beautiful angel, descended from the heavens.

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,640
なんだ ジュドのやつ

1954
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,750
What's Ju-doh's problem?

1955
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,860
いつも悪態ついているのはお前だろうに

1956
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,800
He's the one who's always criticizing the king.

1957
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,970
Hey, the more you look, the more he resembles a rabbit.

1958
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,950
ほれ 見れば見るほどウサギじゃねぇか

1959
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,840
ウサギでなければリスか

1960
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,890
If he isn't a rabbit, he must be a squirrel.

1961
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
どちらにしろ戦場では虎に食い殺されるだけよ

1962
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,060
Either way, he'll get eaten by the tiger on the battlefield.

1963
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,160
まぁいい お手並み拝見と行こう

1964
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,360
Whatever. Let's see what he can do.

1965
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,630
開戦

1966
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,650
Begin!

1967
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,940
What's this?!

1968
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,420
白軍いきなり大胆な戦略

1969
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,110
The white army makes a sudden, bold move!

1970
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,160
Their king, King Su-won, is standing in the center!

1971
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,560
王のスウォン陛下が中央に出ています

1972
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh?

1973
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,400
さすがは我らがグンテ様 受けて立ちました

1974
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,160
Our Lord Geun-tae is meeting their challenge!

1975
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,780
者とも 俺に続け

1976
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,670
Men, follow me!

1977
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,770
赤軍の鬨の声が場内に響き渡ります

1978
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,300
The red army's battle cry rings throughout the arena!

1979
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,510
Though nothing has happened yet, the audience is exhilarated!

1980
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,040
まだ何もしてないのに客席も尋常じゃない盛り上がりです

1981
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,210
さてスウォン陛下 真っ向勝負

1982
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,260
King Su-won prepares for a direct confrontation!

1983
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,220
What?

1984
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,270
Huh?

1985
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,570
なんと スウォン陛下 逃げました

1986
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,600
What's this? King Su-won has fled!

1987
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,860
勇ましく勝負を受けたグンテ様 肩すかしです

1988
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,860
Lord Geun-tae, who gallantly accepted his challenge, is disappointed!

1989
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,620
逃げるだと 何たる腰抜け

1990
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,650
You're running? What a coward!

1991
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,930
しかし 虚をついて白軍の平民がグンテ様に迫る

1992
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,950
But the commoners of the white army catch Lord Geun-tae off guard and attack!

1993
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,390
グンテ様 危ない

1994
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,330
Lord Geun-tae, watch out!

1995
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,700
Lord Geun-tae!

1996
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,820
グンテ様

1997
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Lord Geun-tae!

1998
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,340
お下がりください

1999
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,460
Please step back.

2000
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,560
我々はこのまま赤軍の捕虜となります

2001
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,630
We will become prisoners of the red army.

2002
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,000
元々 私等は人数合わせで白軍に入れられた地の部族

2003
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,000
We're Earth Tribe members, forced to join the white army for the sake of numbers.

2004
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,380
Our hearts belong with the red army.

2005
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,700
心は赤軍にあります

2006
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,420
あなた様に勝利を

2007
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,470
Victory to Lord Geun-tae!

2008
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,240
グンテ様万歳

2009
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,260
Long live Lord Geun-tae!

2010
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,350
I don't want you fools!

2011
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,300
いらんわ このアホ共

2012
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,490
お前ら 俺を愚弄するのか

2013
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,520
Are you mocking me?

2014
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,120
不正しなければ 俺が負けるとでも

2015
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,140
You think I can't win unless I cheat?

2016
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,990
勝負を投げるなど俺が最も嫌うところ

2017
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,020
There is nothing I despise more than giving up.

2018
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,940
そんな腑抜けた忠誠心など俺はいらん

2019
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,980
I don't need your cowardly loyalty!

2020
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,640
犬にでも食わせちまえ

2021
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,730
Go feed it to the dogs!

2022
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,640
泣くな

2023
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,700
Don't cry!

2024
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,780
改めてグンテ様を誇りに思います

2025
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,280
We're just so proud of you, Lord Geun-tae!

2026
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,840
我々が愚かでした お許しを

2027
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,870
We were fools. Forgive us.

2028
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,220
ならば 心を入れ替え

2029
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,420
We will mend our ways! And in a fair fight...

2030
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,700
正々堂々 あなた様をぶっ倒します

2031
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,790
We'll defeat you, sir!

2032
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,750
A king cannot attack a commoner.

2033
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,750
A king cannot attack a commoner.

2034
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,750
A king cannot attack a commoner.

2035
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,750
Crap. They're all commoners.

2036
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,710
やべぇ 全員平民

2037
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,010
Lord Geun-tae is in trouble!

2038
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,960
グンテ様 危うしい

2039
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,580
王は平民に刃を向けられません

2040
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,630
A king cannot attack commoners!

2041
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,500
グンテ様 ご無事で

2042
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,470
Lord Geun-tae, are you all right?

2043
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,180
Yeah.

2044
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,230
A noble of the red army takes out five white commoners at once!

2045
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,840
赤軍貴族 白軍平民五名を一気に殲滅

2046
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,320
捕虜としました

2047
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,900
They are now prisoners, but...

2048
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
だが

2049
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,280
来たか 貴族

2050
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,370
So you've come, nobles?

2051
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,660
待っていたぞ

2052
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,280
I've been waiting for you.

2053
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,210
Nobles!

2054
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,220
貴族共目

2055
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,300
Step forward if you want to die!

2056
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,390
死にたい奴は 前に出ろ

2057
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,590
グンテ様 白軍貴族を次々と倒していきます

2058
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,550
Lord Geun-tae fells one white army noble after another!

2059
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,430
By the way, if you kill them, you'll be disqualified!

2060
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,540
ちなみに 殺してしまっては 失格ですから

2061
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,600
That's it! Draw that expression!

2062
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,820
今の 今の顔描いて

2063
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,730
That isn't fair, Lady Yuno! I want one as well!

2064
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,550
狡い ユウノ様 私も一枚

2065
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,980
The white army's King Su-won is still running around the battlefield, pursued by commoners!

2066
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,100
白軍王のスウォン陛下 平民達に追われ

2067
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,720
いまだ場内を逃げ回っています

2068
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,450
In contrast, the red army's General Geun-tae charges forward to strike down his next opponent!

2069
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,710
対して赤軍王グンテ将軍

2070
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,780
次なる敵を目指して突進

2071
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,500
貴族

2072
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,620
A noble!

2073
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,040
It's white army noble General Han Ju-doh!

2074
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,320
これは白軍貴族 ハンジュド将軍

2075
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,500
空と地の将軍対決や

2076
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,290
It's a showdown between the Sky and Earth generals!

2077
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,290
Ju-doh, you're a noble. How dare you raise your sword against a king?

2078
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,480
ジュド 貴族の分際で何王に刃向けてんだ

2079
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,780
向けているのではない 防御だ

2080
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm not raising it against you. I'm defending myself.

2081
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,240
王の真似事で図に乗るな

2082
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,930
You're only pretending to be a king. Don't let it go to your head!

2083
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,350
Impressive, General Ju-doh.

2084
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,220
さすがはジュド将軍

2085
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,300
お前が本来の二刀流でここが戦場であったなら

2086
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,900
If you were using your two-sword style and we were on the battlefield,

2087
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,360
俺とそいつは今ので真っ二つになっていたかもしれんな

2088
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,400
that move might have cut both me and that other guy in half.

2089
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,680
興が乗ってきた

2090
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,740
This is starting to get interesting.

2091
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,820
お前は俺がヤ♂ル

2092
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,570
I'll kill you.

2093
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,620
単純な男よ

2094
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,660
Such a simple man.

2095
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,940
それでも王か

2096
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,870
And you call yourself a king?

2097
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,750
Huh?

2098
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,320
ここが戦場ならば

2099
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,080
If we were on the battlefield, you would be a fool of a king to look only at me

2100
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,640
俺ばかりを見ていて戦況に気づかぬお前は
愚王となるだろう

2101
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,750
and not pay attention to your surroundings.

2102
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,620
なに

2103
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,500
What?

2104
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,590
Friendly fire!

2105
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,540
自殺点

2106
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,920
赤軍同士で皿を割ってしまった

2107
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,970
Red soldiers are smashing each other's plates!

2108
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,280
なんとスウォン陛下 転んでしまったようです

2109
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,140
King Su-won seems to have tripped!

2110
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,040
赤軍の振り下ろされた木刀は味方に当たってしまいました

2111
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,020
The red soldiers have accidentally struck their own men!

2112
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,690
What incredible luck.

2113
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
なんと言う幸運

2114
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,510
この場合 白軍の点として加算されます

2115
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,770
These points will be counted in favor of the white army!

2116
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,760
幸運だと

2117
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,900
Luck?

2118
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,640
そしてスウォン陛下
混乱に乗じて赤軍の陣地にグングン入り込む

2119
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,700
King Su-won uses the confusion to plunge deeper into the red army's position!

2120
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,920
させるか

2121
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
You aren't going anywhere!

2122
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,370
Lord Geun-tae is on the move!

2123
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,320
グンテ様も動いた

2124
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,780
陛下 覚悟

2125
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,750
King, prepare yourself!

2126
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,290
King Su-won is in a desperate situation!

2127
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,770
スウォン陛下 絶体絶命

2128
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,180
What an incredible coincidence!

2129
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,500
すごい偶然

2130
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,350
A little farther, and he would have broken his plate.

2131
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,310
もう少しずれてたら 皿 割れてましたよ

2132
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,980
いや 脳天割れてたかも

2133
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,190
No, perhaps he would have broken his skull!

2134
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,500
なんだ

2135
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,110
What?

2136
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,210
今 俺を見た

2137
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,150
Was he just looking at me?

2138
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,160
俺を狙った

2139
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,410
Was he aiming for me?

2140
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,480
すいません グンテ将軍

2141
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,530
I'm sorry, General Geun-tae!

2142
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,180
大丈夫ですか

2143
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,120
Are you all right?

2144
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,810
こやつ 本当にウサギか

2145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,830
Is this man really a rabbit?

2146
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,270
すごい偶然

2147
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,300
What an incredible coincidence!

2148
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,910
スウォン陛下の弾いた木刀がグンテ様の脳天すれすれに落ちた

2149
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,930
The wooden sword deflected by King Su-won nearly struck Lord Geun-tae's head!

2150
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,020
偶然 いや

2151
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,970
A coincidence? No...

2152
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,140
狙ったのだ 俺の目の前を

2153
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,970
He was aiming right in front of me.

2154
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,180
あの目は ウサギか

2155
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,560
Are those the eyes of a rabbit?

2156
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,650
King Su-won releases the white army prisoners!

2157
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,620
スウォン陛下 白軍捕虜達を解放

2158
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,880
兵の数では赤軍を上回りましたが

2159
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,900
Though they now have more soldiers than the red army,

2160
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,400
また皿を割れれば 敵に得点を与えることとなります

2161
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,230
if their plates are broken again, that will mean more points for their opponents!

2162
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,490
Will this work for them or against them?

2163
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,550
吉と出るか 凶と出るか

2164
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,290
解放された白軍兵 四方散り散りになって 赤軍に勝負を挑む

2165
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,330
The released prisoners scatter to engage the red army!

2166
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,180
そして スウォン陛下は

2167
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,870
And King Su-won...

2168
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,220
まだもや平民い追い回されています

2169
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,870
is being chased by commoners again!

2170
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,920
なんだ そりゃ

2171
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,210
What is he doing?

2172
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,960
さっきのは 俺の見間違いか

2173
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,090
Was I mistaken?

2174
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,340
突風です 砂埃が闘技場を舞う

2175
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,970
A sudden gust sends clouds of dust flying throughout the arena!

2176
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,340
I can't see.

2177
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,500
視界が...

2178
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,360
今のは何方の兵だ

2179
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,180
Whose soldier was that?

2180
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,640
White shadows?

2181
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,610
白兵かい

2182
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,660
まずい

2183
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,390
Damn!

2184
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,760
適当に散り散りになってるわけじゃねぇ

2185
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,810
They didn't scatter at random.

2186
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,120
貴族 平民の混合組に分かれて 赤軍を追い込んでいる

2187
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,020
They're attacking the red army with mixed groups of nobles and commoners.

2188
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,160
赤軍 バラバラになるな

2189
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,190
Red army, stay together!

2190
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,520
態勢を立て直す 集まれ

2191
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,440
We'll regroup! Come to me!

2192
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,070
クソ

2193
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,360
Damn it.

2194
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,160
How is the white army controlling its forces amid this dust?

2195
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,420
白軍はこの中で どうやって兵共の統制を

2196
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,800
赤軍...

2197
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,620
Red army!

2198
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,170
Have you come for my head?

2199
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,540
俺の首を取りに来たか

2200
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,540
I would never!

2201
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,840
そんな 滅相もない

2202
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
ただ私は陛下が

2203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,340
But the king told us you like heroes who challenge their enemies.

2204
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,340
グンテ様は勝負を挑む勇者がお好きだとおっしゃるので

2205
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,380
The king?

2206
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,640
陛下が

2207
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,240
俺の部下の動かし方をよく分かっている

2208
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,350
He knows how to motivate my people.

2209
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,860
お前ら 砂埃の中でよく動けたな

2210
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,890
I'm impressed you were able to move around in this dust.

2211
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,640
風が来たら 風上に立つようにと陛下がご指示を

2212
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,100
The king instructed us to stand upwind when the wind came.

2213
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,560
風を呼んでいたのか

2214
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,610
He was expecting the wind?

2215
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,970
では この作戦の指示を出しているのも 陛下か

2216
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,990
Is your king directing this strategy as well?

2217
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,580
は はい

2218
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,450
Y-Yes, sir.

2219
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,540
俺は 侮り過ぎていた

2220
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,910
I underestimated him.

2221
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,640
先程の砂嵐後 赤軍の兵は大幅に減ってしまいました

2222
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,620
After that sandstorm, the red army's numbers are severely diminished!

2223
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,790
Will this be our first and final battle of the kings?

2224
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,770
最初で最後の王対決か

2225
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,090
グンテ様

2226
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,130
Lord Geun-tae...

2227
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,630
The king isn't fleeing. He's baiting my men.

2228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,660
陛下は逃げ回ってるのではない 誘導しているのだ

2229
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,920
赤軍を殲滅場所へ

2230
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,630
He's luring the red army to defeat.

2231
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,920
白軍は 地の部族がほとんどの士気が低い連中なのに

2232
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,010
The white army is composed primarily of meek Earth Tribe members.

2233
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,500
捕虜から復活させて 士気を高め

2234
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,520
But they raised their morale by releasing their prisoners

2235
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,000
なんだかんだで 上手く動かしてやがる

2236
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,810
and are moving effectively, somehow.

2237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,140
ウサギのように逃げ回ると見せかけておいて

2238
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,150
He's only pretending to flee like a rabbit.

2239
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,900
What is his true nature?

2240
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,080
本性はなんだ

2241
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,820
General Geun-tae, that hurts!

2242
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,770
グンテ将軍 痛いです

2243
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,560
口とは裏腹に 俺の刀をしっかり止めていやがる

2244
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,530
Despite what he says, he's stopping my blows.

2245
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,160
赤軍 まだやられてしまった

2246
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,870
The red army has lost more soldiers!

2247
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
なんと言うことでしょう

2248
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,830
How can this be?

2249
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,750
Lord Geun-tae is the last remaining member of the red army!

2250
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,810
赤軍はグンテ様一人になってしまいました

2251
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,220
これでは いかにグンテ様といえども...

2252
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,920
Not even Lord Geun-tae can escape this situation.

2253
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,820
さて 貴方は一人です グンテ将軍

2254
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,470
You're alone, General Geun-tae.

2255
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,620
ここは戦場ならば 貴方は確実に死にます

2256
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,350
If this place were a battlefield, you would certainly die.

2257
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,810
What will you do?

2258
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,020
どうしますか

2259
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,570
The fleeing rabbit now seems like a hawk fixated on its prey.

2260
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,560
逃げ回るだけだったウサギが

2261
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,600
今は狙った獲物を逃さぬ鷹に見える

2262
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,850
そんな状況だから 相手がでかく見えるか

2263
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,900
Does he seem larger because of the situation?

2264
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,580
たかだこんな遊びに

2265
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,860
Even though it's only a game?

2266
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,340
いや そうではない そうではないのだ

2267
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,370
No, that's not it. That's not it at all.

2268
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,980
一つ提案します

2269
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,040
I have a suggestion.

2270
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,040
This may be a friendly competition,

2271
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,920
試合とはいえ

2272
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,620
グンテ将軍が民衆の前で負けては立つ瀬がないでしょう

2273
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,420
but if you're defeated in front of your people, you'll lose face.

2274
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,000
復活の機会を与えます

2275
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,800
I'll grant you a second chance.

2276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,820
捕虜を解放し もう一度勝負をするというのは如何です

2277
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,430
Why don't I release the prisoners, so we can battle once more?

2278
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,100
断る

2279
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,060
I decline your offer.

2280
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,380
戦場ならば 死者は蘇らない

2281
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,520
On the battlefield, the dead do not come back to life.

2282
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,540
例え目の前が千の敵だとて 俺は戦う

2283
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,440
Even if a thousand enemies stand before me, I will fight!

2284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,380
面目などを気にして 国が救えるか

2285
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,070
Worrying about my reputation will not save the kingdom!

2286
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,320
もうたかが遊びではないのだ

2287
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,410
This isn't just a game anymore.

2288
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,040
これはこの国の王が 仕えるにたる人間かを見定めるため

2289
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,830
It's an opportunity for me to determine whether this nation's king is worth serving.

2290
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,250
では私がお相手を

2291
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,000
Then I will accept your challenge.

2292
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,180
束でかかってきても構いませんよ

2293
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,920
I don't mind taking you all on!

2294
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,500
Lord Geun-tae seemed to be in a desperate situation,

2295
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,460
絶体絶命と思われたグンテ様が

2296
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,660
陛下と一騎打ちを

2297
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,420
but now he's fighting the king one-on-one!

2298
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,800
Lord Geun-tae!

2299
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,160
グンテ様

2300
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,760
Lord Geun-tae!

2301
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,350
He wields his sword calmly against me,

2302
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,340
この俺を相手に 冷静な剣捌き

2303
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,460
だが それだけでは分からん この王は真の王か否か

2304
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,720
but that doesn't tell me enough.

2305
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,100
Is this man a true king or not?

2306
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,230
You're mine!

2307
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,190
もらった

2308
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,990
What?

2309
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,260
あら

2310
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,670
All right! Victory!

2311
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,550
やった 勝利

2312
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,040
まだ勝ってないけど

2313
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,710
He hasn't won yet, though.

2314
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,750
グンテ様 勝利です

2315
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,210
But Lord Geun-tae is victorious!

2316
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,550
I knew our general could do it! He's got it!

2317
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,520
さすが我らが将軍 持ってる男

2318
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,660
この場で決めました

2319
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,260
He has won the battle!

2320
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,520
いや さすがはグンテ将軍

2321
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,430
That was impressive, General Geun-tae.

2322
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,720
You defeated me.

2323
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,800
やられちゃいましたね

2324
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,430
What was that?

2325
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,360
なんですか 今の

2326
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,060
やっぱりお強いですね

2327
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,100
You truly are strong.

2328
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,260
お戯れを

2329
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,180
Don't play games.

2330
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,390
Uh...

2331
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,900
Once more. Stand.

2332
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,340
もう一度だ 立て

2333
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,360
Wh-What should we do?

2334
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,320
ど どうしましょう

2335
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,650
だんだん言葉使いが怪しく

2336
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,690
He's starting to sound weird.

2337
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,420
試合はまだ続いている 行け

2338
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,190
The competition isn't over yet. Go.

2339
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,400
その後 ついにグンテ将軍の皿が割られ 赤軍は全滅

2340
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,950
Later, General Geun-tae's plate was finally broken,

2341
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,200
and the red army was annihilated.

2342
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,940
しかし 将軍も最後に大暴れ

2343
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,410
However, the general didn't go down without a fight.

2344
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,560
ただではやられまいと

2345
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,460
Refusing to go quietly, he took out four nobles,

2346
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,440
貴族四人を倒したため

2347
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,320
結果的に白軍を得点で上回り 赤軍が勝利したのです

2348
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,300
earning the red army enough points to win.

2349
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:16,110
地心の都では 奇跡の勝利として夜通し宴が催されました

2350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,130
In Chishin, the miraculous victory was celebrated all night.

2351
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,140
That festival was fun.

2352
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,430
いや 楽しいお祭りでしたね

2353
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,650
どうしたんですか グンテ将軍

2354
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,850
What's wrong, General Geun-tae?

2355
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,880
なにを怒ってるんですか

2356
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,940
What are you upset about?

2357
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,580
一体 何しにきたんですか 陛下は

2358
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,570
Why did you come here, King?

2359
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,980
地心城に来て うろうろして

2360
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,950
All you did was wander around the castle, have tea with my wife,

2361
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,320
and frolic about at a festival.

2362
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,140
嫁と茶して 祭りで騒いで 遊んでただけではないですか

2363
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,920
グンテ将軍 ジュド将軍に似てきましたね

2364
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,080
General Geun-tae, you're starting to sound like General Ju-doh.

2365
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
一緒にしないで頂きたい

2366
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,500
Don't compare him to me!

2367
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,720
この王に何かを感じた気がしたが 錯覚か

2368
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,790
I thought I sensed something in this king, but was I wrong?

2369
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,780
グンテ様 グンテ様

2370
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,790
Lord Geun-tae, Lord Geun-tae!

2371
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,270
聞いて 聞いて すごいの

2372
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,300
Listen to this. It's incredible.

2373
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,440
どうした

2374
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,210
What is it?

2375
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,840
私のお茶を 戒帝国の商団さんが買いたいんですって

2376
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,930
Some merchants from the Kai Empire want to buy my tea.

2377
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,180
Your tea? You mean this smelly tea?

2378
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,290
茶って この臭い茶か

2379
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,520
It isn't smelly. It has a floral fragrance!

2380
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,580
臭くない お花の香り

2381
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,950
戒帝国では お花の香りのお茶がとても好まれるんですって

2382
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,860
The people of the Kai Empire love fragrant, floral teas.

2383
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,360
Seriously?

2384
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,240
まじでか

2385
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,040
でもどうしよう

2386
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,900
But what should I do?

2387
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,700
My tea plantation is too small to supply the Kai Empire.

2388
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,740
私の茶畑は戒帝国を相手にするには小さ過ぎるの

2389
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,200
As long as you expand gradually, you'll be fine.

2390
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,680
大丈夫ですよ 徐々に広げてゆけば

2391
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,780
大量に安売りしないで

2392
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,910
Instead of selling large amounts cheaply,

2393
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,100
地心特産高級茶として売り出せば この都に人が集まります

2394
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,750
if you market it as a high-quality specialty tea of Chishin,

2395
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,210
people will come to this city.

2396
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,770
人は 入手しにくい物ほど 必死で欲しがる生き物ですからね

2397
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,050
The more difficult something is to acquire, the more desperately people want it.

2398
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,420
Yes, King.

2399
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,680
はい 陛下

2400
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,380
グンテ様 ウド鉱山が

2401
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,430
Lord Geun-tae, Udo Mine is...

2402
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,520
ヒデ爺 また落盤か

2403
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,560
Elder Hi-dea, did it collapse again?

2404
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,020
違う 違うよ

2405
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,020
No, it's not that.

2406
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,100
We don't have enough workers. We're so busy.

2407
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,580
人手が足らねぇんだ 大忙し

2408
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,880
大忙し

2409
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,900
Busy?

2410
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,260
グンテ様が模擬戦で身に着けられてた石があったじゃろ

2411
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,280
Remember the stones you wore to the mock battle?

2412
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,420
あれの注文が殺到しての

2413
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,360
We've received an overwhelming number of orders for them.

2414
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,320
Huh? That's impossible.

2415
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,640
あ まさが あんな大して輝かない石

2416
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,820
Those stones hardly even sparkle.

2417
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,730
だから今まで誰も価値があるなんて思ってなかった

2418
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,750
That's why no one thought they had any value until now.

2419
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,870
だが職人が磨いてみたら なかなかどうして美しい

2420
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,920
However, after our artisans polish them, they're quite beautiful.

2421
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,580
それよりなにより

2422
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,010
More than anything, they're the stones of victory that you wore when you won.

2423
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,180
グンテ様が身に着けて勝利された必勝の石

2424
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,720
Of course everyone wants them.

2425
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,860
そりゃ皆欲しいわな

2426
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,050
I've already got my own.

2427
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,360
ちなみに 俺はもう持ってる

2428
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,930
Why would you wear that?

2429
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,770
じじがあんなもんつけて どうすんだ

2430
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,350
Doesn't it look cool?

2431
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,800
格好よかろ

2432
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,420
いいな 私も欲しい

2433
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,230
How pretty. I want one as well.

2434
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,230
The tea was delicious.

2435
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,360
あぁ お茶美味しかった

2436
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,270
Mister Hi-dea, I'd like one, too!

2437
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,960
ヒデさん 私の分も

2438
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,560
General Ju-doh, should we go?

2439
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,470
ジュド将軍 そろそろ行きましょうか

2440
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,270
This will have a great effect on our economy!

2441
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,040
これすごい経済効果ありますよ

2442
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,340
はい

2443
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,190
Yes, sir.

2444
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,610
Anyway, Yuno, you're amazing.

2445
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,120
にしてもいうの お前はすげぇな

2446
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,420
どうして

2447
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,530
Why?

2448
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,000
俺の知らないうちに

2449
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,990
While I wasn't watching,

2450
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,410
you negotiated with the Kai Empire and discovered a valuable jewel.

2451
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,300
戒の商団と交渉したり 値打ちもんの宝石を発見したり

2452
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,680
私は何もしてないよ

2453
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,620
I didn't do anything.

2454
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,750
But you...

2455
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,020
だって お前...

2456
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,180
私は試合中

2457
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:00,130
During the competition, I simply served tea to a guest that the king introduced me to.

2458
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,140
陛下が紹介してくださったお客様にお茶をお出ししただけよ

2459
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,970
I chose your outfit, but the king suggested you wear the stones.

2460
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,480
衣装を見立てたのは私だけど

2461
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,100
石を身に着けるように提案されたのは陛下だし

2462
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,400
陛下はどこに

2463
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,560
Where is the king?!

2464
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,270
The king has left.

2465
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,700
陛下ならお帰りになったよ

2466
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,060
帰った

2467
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,270
He left?!

2468
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,260
まったく あなたというお方は

2469
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,230
You're unbelievable.

2470
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,530
How much of that did you plan?

2471
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,980
一体どこまで計算されていたのか

2472
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,700
だってもったいないと思いません

2473
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,740
Don't you think it's a waste?

2474
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,240
自分がどれ程民に影響力があるかを知らず

2475
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,540
He lounges around his castle, unaware of the influence he has over his people.

2476
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,900
日々お城でくすぶっているなんて

2477
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,680
地の部族はよく分かりません

2478
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,660
I don't understand the Earth Tribe.

2479
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,750
What's so great about that rude man?

2480
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,480
あんな不作法な男の何がいいんだか

2481
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,490
私は好きですよ グンテ将軍

2482
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,550
I like General Geun-tae.

2483
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,000
そして ますます彼が欲しくなりました

2484
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,920
And now I want him even more.

2485
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,740
もし

2486
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,930
If we're eventually forced to go to war,

2487
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,960
いずれ本当に戦という手段を取らざるを得なくなった時

2488
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:55,020
the Earth Tribe forces he leads will be the most spirited among the five tribes.

2489
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,250
彼が率いる地の部族兵の士気は恐らく五部族一でしょう

2490
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,700
その勢いは必ずや高華国の力となる

2491
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,570
Their intensity will be a great asset to Kouka Kingdom.

2492
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,570
He really left.

2493
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,620
本当に帰りやがった

2494
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,370
I knew it. That pretender lost intentionally.

2495
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,460
あんなすっとぼけ王め やっぱりわざと負けやがったな

2496
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,360
全てこれが狙いだったのか

2497
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,290
Everything he did was for this purpose.

2498
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,830
The war games,

2499
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,460
戦ごっこも 茶畑や鉱山を見学してたのも 全て

2500
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,130
his visits to the tea plantation and the mine, everything.

2501
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,550
For a boy so young, that was damned interesting!

2502
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,460
若造のくせに おもしれぇことしやがる

2503
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,800
お蔭で 地心が潤っちまうじゃねぇか バカヤロ

2504
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,300
You're going to make Chishin rich, you idiot!

2505
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,600
やはりあの目は見間違いではなかった

2506
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,310
I wasn't wrong about his eyes.

2507
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,520
緩く見せかけて 底知れぬ熱を腹に抱えてやがる眼差しだ

2508
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,400
He pretends to be weak, but his eyes burn with unfathomable heat.

2509
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,650
In some ways, he's more terrifying than Lord Yu-hon.

2510
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,680
ある意味 ユホン様より恐ろしい

2511
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,000
なかなか見所がある男だ

2512
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,740
He's a promising man.

2513
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,240
奴に期待してもよいのか

2514
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,070
Can I place my hopes in him?

2515
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,680
なに いずれ会いに行けば はっきりすすことよ

2516
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,620
Well, it'll all become clear when I go to see him eventually.

2517
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:24,070
Crying tears for the days that won't return

2518
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:24,070
modoranai hibi ni namida koboshite

2519
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:33,540
You look up to the sky, and it's burning bright red

2520
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:33,540
miageta sora ga akaku akaku moeru

2521
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:46,510
Now that you know your own strength and weakness

2522
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:46,510
jibun no tsuyosa yowasa kizuketa no nara ima

2523
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:54,680
You should have no fear and go where your heart takes you

2524
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:54,680
kimi yo osoreruna kokoro omomuku mama

2525
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,810
Cleaving through the wind, your path is lit

2526
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,810
kaze wo kirisusumu sono tabiji wo

2527
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,820
By the dawn

2528
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,820
akatsuki ga terasu

2529
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,900
(Gather, fierce arm)

2530
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,900
(tsudoe takeki kaina)

2531
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,610
(All-seeing eyes)

2532
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,610
(senri no hitomi)

2533
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,990
Feet that dash through the sky

2534
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,990
sora wo kakeyuku ashi

2535
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,450
(Shield of eternity)

2536
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,450
(kuon no tate)

2537
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,030
Fulfill the ancient vows

2538
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,030
inishie no chikai ima hatashite

2539
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,870
O night, break into dawn

2540
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,870
yoru yo akete yuke

2541
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:41,060
Next Time

2542
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,340
逃げ切って見せるさ 定めから

2543
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,260
I will escape my destiny.

2544
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,860
緋龍王が現れたって 僕は蹴り飛ばして見せるよ

2545
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,800
Even if King Hiryuu appears, I will kick him away.

2546
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,920
次回 暁のヨナ 第十七話
