Episode 19:      The Senjuso Test

247
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,620
A life-threatening job?

248
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,920
命がけの仕事

249
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,080
今のお前は何の役にも立たないお荷物だ

250
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,710
Right now, you're useless baggage.

251
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,980
それでも私らと一緒にクムジと戦うってんなら

252
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,920
But if you insist on fighting Kum-ji with us,

253
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,840
you must demonstrate your resolve.

254
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,800
それ相応の覚悟を見せてもらうよ

255
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
覚悟

256
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,930
My resolve...

257
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,200
分かった 何をすればいいの

258
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,140
I understand. What do I have to do?

259
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,420
千樹草を取ってきてもらおうか

260
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,890
Pick me some senjuso.

261
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,520
Captain, isn't that-

262
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,470
船長 それは...

263
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,360
口を挟むんじゃないよ

264
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,480
Don't interrupt me.

265
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,790
お前には無理だろ

266
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,940
You could never do it.

267
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,900
千樹草って

268
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,610
What's senjuso?

269
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,080
雲隠れ岬にしか生えない貴重な薬草でね

270
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,070
It's a valuable medicinal herb that grows only on the Mist-Shrouded Cape...

271
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,200
A cure-all that speeds up healing
of illnesses and wounds.

272
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,280
病や傷の治りを激的に早める万能薬さ

273
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,120
A cure-all?

274
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,520
万能薬

275
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,140
千樹草があれば今負傷している仲間も早く回復する

276
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,870
With the senjuso, my injured
men will recover quickly.

277
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,440
これからの戦いに大いに必要なものだ

278
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,380
In our upcoming battle,
we will have great need for it.

279
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,260
丁度いつも取りに行っている奴が負傷しててね

280
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,380
The man I usually send to pick it
is currently injured.

281
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,440
そいつの代わりをしてくれなら お前を認めてやるよ

282
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,130
If you'll do it in his place, I'll accept you.

283
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,960
分かった

284
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,010
Fine.

285
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,350
Oh, I forgot to mention...

286
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
言い忘れてたけど

287
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,080
千樹草は断崖絶壁の中腹に生えている

288
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,230
The senjuso grows in the middle of a sheer cliff.

289
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,860
誰の手も借りずに一人で行くんだよ

290
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,650
You'll go alone, without anyone's help.

291
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,480
Huh?

292
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,420
初めからそのつもり

293
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,400
That was already my intention.

294
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,900
Yona, this is crazy!

295
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,880
ヨナ 無茶だよ

296
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,670
ユン お願い

297
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,610
Yun... Please.

298
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,680
これは私の 仕事だから

299
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,620
This is my job.

300
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,180
いい心掛けだ

301
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,080
Good attitude.

302
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,880
ジェハ 案内しておやり

303
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,000
Jae-ha, show her the way.

304
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,680
はい はい

305
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,250
All right, all right.

306
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,560
じゃあ ちょっと行ってくる

307
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,500
Well, I'm off.

308
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,720
すぐ戻るね

309
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,130
I'll be back soon.

310
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,580
あそこに小さな足場があるだろう

311
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,670
You see that narrow path?

312
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,220
そこから降りていくと
ちょうど君が入れるくらいの空洞がある

313
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,220
It will take you to a cave
just large enough for you to fit in.

314
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,680
そこにある千樹草を摘んでくる

315
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,720
Pick the senjuso there.

316
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,870
それだけだ

317
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,810
That's all.

318
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,280
簡単だろう

319
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,230
Easy, right?

320
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,960
簡単

321
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,940
"Easy"? Even I know that was mean.

322
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,160
我ながら意地悪だな

323
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,180
この状況に足が竦まない人間はいない

324
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,990
This situation would paralyze anyone with fear.

325
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,370
試しとはいえ ギガン船長も酷なことを

326
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,490
Captain Gi-gan's tests are ruthless.

327
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,030
Okay!

328
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,200
よし

329
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,460
大丈夫

330
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,210
It's all right.

331
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,740
ギガン船長は体の小さな私に見合う仕事をくれたのよ

332
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,670
Captain Gi-gan gave me this job
after seeing how small I am.

333
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,270
My legs won't move.

334
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,100
足が 動かない

335
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,720
嫌だ ここに居たくない

336
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,640
I don't want to be here!

337
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm afraid! I'm afraid!

338
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,690
Help me!

339
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,700
助けて

340
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't want to die!

341
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,300
死にたくない

342
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,150
Calm down.

343
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,200
落ち着いて

344
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,820
The wind isn't that strong.

345
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,880
大して風じゃない

346
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,440
先代が言っていた

347
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,280
My predecessor told me that

348
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,620
緋龍王とは四龍にとっては血に刻まれた絶対なる君主

349
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,620
absolute devotion to King Hiryuu was etched into the blood of the four dragons.

350
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,460
I wondered what sort of man would come.

351
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,240
どんな男が来るのかと思っていた

352
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,400
きっと強大な力で四龍を支配する
偉ぶった野郎なんだろうと

353
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,380
I imagined a conceited man, who would use force to command the dragons.

354
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,120
しかし

355
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:49,350
However, the one standing here is a weak girl,
without any special strength.

356
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,460
ここにいるのは特別な力など何も持たない
まぎれもないか弱い少女

357
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,960
あの時 四龍を統べる者だと 僕の血が認めた

358
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,100
At that moment, my blood recognized her as the one to rule the four dragons.

359
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,400
だが

360
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,070
But is this weak girl trembling before me that person?

361
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,460
目の前のこんなにも弱い震えている少女が

362
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,260
その人だというのか

363
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,320
Is she really the four dragons' master?

364
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,500
本当に 彼女が四龍の主なのか

365
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,440
ヨナちゃん 無理することはない

366
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,990
Yona, you don't need to force yourself.

367
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
怖ければ 戻ればいい

368
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,830
If you're afraid, come back.

369
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,360
船長の与えた仕事は無理だ

370
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,120
The job the captain gave you is impossible.

371
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,220
よって 君は僕らとともにクムジと戦うことはできないけれど

372
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,050
It would mean you can't fight
against Kum-ji with us,

373
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,020
だれもそんなこと強制していないのだから

374
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,090
but no one is forcing you to do this.

375
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,220
君が自ら危険に飛び込む必要はない

376
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,890
You don't need to put yourself in danger!

377
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,720
そうだ 戻れ

378
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,430
That's right. Come back.

379
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,140
君は女の子なんだから

380
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,930
You're only a girl.

381
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,560
戻れ

382
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,390
Come back.

383
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,360
Yona!

384
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,760
ヨナ

385
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,860
I won't go back.

386
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,200
戻れ...ない

387
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,930
大丈夫

388
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,950
It's okay.

389
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,640
何が大丈夫だ

390
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,660
It is not okay!

391
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,830
こんな 簡単な仕事

392
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,820
I have to do this simple job.

393
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,200
It isn't simple!

394
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,240
何が簡単だ

395
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:59,130
If I don't, I won't be able to face
Captain Gi-gan or Hak and the others.

396
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,160
こなせなきゃ ギガン船長は勿論

397
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,190
ハク達にも 合わせる顔ないもの

398
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,340
Ao, thank you.

399
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,220
アオ ありがとう

400
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,160
頑張る

401
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,010
I'll do my best.

402
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,860
震えるが 止まった訳でも
涙が止まった訳でもないのに

403
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,470
How can you keep moving forward,
when you're still trembling and crying?

404
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,840
どうして進める

405
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,320
君のような力のない女の子が

406
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,810
You're only a powerless girl!

407
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,460
ヨナちゃん

408
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,690
Yona?

409
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,340
よかった 薬が目的で

410
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,070
I'm glad I'm here to get the medicine.

411
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,640
どうして

412
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,450
Why?

413
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,560
例えば

414
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:38,660
Suppose Hak, Yun, Ki-ja, or Sin-ha were gravely injured right now.

415
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,980
今 ハクやユン キジャやシンアが大怪我をしてたとして

416
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,280
千樹草があれば治るものであったなら

417
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,840
If the senjuso could heal them,
I'd do anything to acquire it.

418
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,820
私は何があっても取りに行く

419
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,540
例え矢の降る戦場の真ん中に生えていても 取りに行く

420
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,430
Even if it were growing in the middle of a battlefield with arrows raining down,

421
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,680
I would still go to pick it.

422
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,390
When I think of it that way,
I can go anywhere.

423
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,360
そう思えば どこへだって行けるよ

424
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,900
足 震えてるよ

425
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,730
Your legs are shaking.

426
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,440
誰が失うのが怖いかい

427
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,230
Are you afraid of losing someone?

428
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,420
怖い

429
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,230
I am afraid.

430
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,860
I fear that more than anything else.

431
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,000
それが一番怖いの

432
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,530
I fear seeing someone crying
over losing another, too.

433
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,420
誰かを失って泣く人を見るのも

434
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,340
誰かを失いたくないという思いが

435
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:20,500
Her desire not to lose anyone
moves her shaking legs forward.

436
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,500
震える足を前に進ませるのか

437
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,540
Right now, she acts for the people of Awa who are terrified of Kum-ji.

438
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,540
今は クムジに怯える阿波の人々のため

439
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,660
どこかのバカと同じだ

440
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,510
She reminds me of some idiots I know.

441
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,820
いや 少し力があるだけ バカのがましだね

442
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,010
No, at least an idiot is better off
for having a little strength.

443
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,640
見てらんない

444
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,600
I can't watch this anymore.

445
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,060
Jae-ha...

446
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,420
ジェハ

447
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,300
ついてきてくれるの

448
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,230
You're coming with me?

449
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,770
Huh? Oh...

450
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,030
Well, partway. I'm keeping an eye on you.

451
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,280
まぁ まぁ 途中までね 見張りだよ

452
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,110
Thank you.

453
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,120
ありがとう

454
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,740
Just so you know, I won't help you.

455
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,160
言っとくけど 手は貸さないよ

456
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,420
I know, but having your voice nearby is reassuring.

457
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,700
うん でも あなたの声が近くにあると 安心するの

458
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
そこに居てくれるだけで

459
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,540
Just having you near.

460
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,750
I wonder why.

461
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,760
どうしてかな

462
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,970
Why? I'd like to ask you the same question.

463
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,600
どうして

464
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,980
こっちが聞きたいよ

465
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:23,520
この僕が もっと君の声を 姿を
感じていたいと思うなんて 初めて会った時よりも

466
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:22,850
Why do I want to hear and see you now, even more than when we first met?

467
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,300
これも四龍の血が僕の体に流れているせいだろう

468
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,480
It must be because of the dragon's blood
flowing through my veins.

469
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,220
きっとそうに違いない

470
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,110
That must be it.

471
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,160
それ以外 何がある

472
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,990
What else could it be?

473
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,840
なんて四龍の血とは 厄介なんだ

474
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,830
The dragon's blood is such a pain in the ass.

475
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,380
さて 僕はここまでだよ

476
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,670
This is as far as I'll go.

477
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,300
この先は狭くて僕は行けない

478
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,380
The path ahead is too narrow for me.

479
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,960
君だけで行くんだ

480
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,000
You'll have to go alone.

481
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,060
ずっと 強くなりたかった

482
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,890
I always wanted to become stronger.

483
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,100
初めは自分を守るため

484
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,930
At first, it was to protect myself.

485
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,810
次は 私のためにすべてを捨ててきたハクを守るため

486
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,900
Next, it was to protect Hak,
who gave up everything for me.

487
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,340
そして 私を生かしてくれた仲間達に報いるため

488
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,200
Now, it's to repay my friends,
who enabled me to live.

489
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,000
Move, legs!

490
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,560
足よ 動け

491
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,290
Little by little, one step at a time.

492
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,290
少しずつでも 一方ずつでも

493
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,060
この恐怖に打ち勝てば

494
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:35,630
If I can beat this fear, surely I will be that much closer to the strength I desired.

495
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,420
きっと

496
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,600
欲しかった強さに 近づける気がするから

497
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,940
これが千樹草

498
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,020
This is the senjuso?

499
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,060
よかった

500
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,280
Thank goodness.

501
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,280
私にも辿り着けた

502
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,160
I made it here.

503
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,820
どうしました 船長

504
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,910
What is it, Captain?

505
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,600
時化てきたね

506
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,620
The water's getting choppy.

507
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,390
え そうっすか

508
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,330
Huh? It is?

509
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,460
この分じゃ 急がないとあの娘やばいね

510
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,630
That girl will be in trouble if she doesn't hurry.

511
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,170
Thunder Beast?

512
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,440
雷獣

513
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,720
What do you want?

514
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
なんたい

515
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,570
案内してくれ

516
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,640
Show me the way.

517
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,810
Yona, are you okay?

518
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,680
ヨナちゃん 大丈夫

519
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,140
Yes.

520
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,430
Yona!

521
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,640
ヨナ

522
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,560
Go back inside!

523
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,560
戻れ

524
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,900
Yona?

525
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,240
ヨナちゃん

526
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,720
ヨナ

527
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,780
Yona!

528
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,120
Yona!

529
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,320
ヨナ

530
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,700
何てことだ こんな近くにいて助けられないなんて

531
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,830
I don't believe it.

532
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,500
I was so close, but I couldn't save her.

533
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,800
That weak... That weak girl.

534
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,960
あんなに あんなにか弱い少女を

535
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,740
ジェハ

536
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,550
Jae-ha...

537
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,900
ヨナちゃん

538
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,140
Yona!

539
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,460
大丈夫か 今助ける

540
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,270
Are you okay? I'll save you.

541
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,600
No!

542
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,300
ダメ

543
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:17,900
If you help me now,
then my promise to Captain Gi-gan...

544
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,020
ここで手を借りたら

545
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,220
ギガン船長との約束が

546
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,340
君って子は

547
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,110
You're unbelievable.

548
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,100
ジェハ

549
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,500
Jae-ha?

550
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,360
まったく 凄い子だよ 君は

551
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,340
You know, you're incredible.

552
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,220
この僕をここまでハラハラさせるんだからね

553
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,390
You manage to leave me breathless.

554
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,940
結局 助けられちゃった

555
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,770
I needed your help, after all.

556
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,480
見損なわないでほしいな

557
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,730
Don't get the wrong idea.

558
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,580
僕は本来 女性は真綿でくるむように大事にする主義なんだ

559
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,270
Treating women with the greatest care
is one of my principles.

560
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
なにわ笑ってんだい 能天気

561
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,490
What are you laughing about?

562
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,400
この海に飛び込んでまで助けようとしてくれたのね

563
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,990
You were ready to jump into the sea to save me.

564
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,560
ありがとう

565
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,500
Thank you.

566
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,960
Don't tell the captain.

567
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,000
船長には内緒だ

568
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,670
Huh? But...

569
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,780
でも

570
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,670
It's that.

571
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,700
それ

572
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,170
You picked and protected the senjuso yourself.

573
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,300
その千樹草は君が自分の力で手に入れ 守った

574
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,840
だから船長との約束は果たされたんだ

575
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,680
You kept your promise to the captain.

576
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,680
What I did was just a bonus.

577
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,480
僕が今やったことはおまけ

578
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,840
船長に言う必要はない

579
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,310
You don't need to tell the captain about it.

580
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,110
I haven't done anything yet.

581
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,100
まだ 全然果たせてないわ

582
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,440
これを持って 皆の元へ帰らないと

583
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,480
I need to take this back to the others.

584
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,520
ね こんなところに生えてるの 千樹草

585
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,490
So the senjuso grows here?

586
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,830
I told you it was a sheer cliff.

587
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:49,620
Princess...

588
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,080
言ったろう 絶壁だって

589
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:49,700
Princess...

590
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:49,790
Princess...

591
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,410
Princess...

592
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,500
Yeah, but it's too steep!

593
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,520
絶壁すぎでしょ

594
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,620
This is crazy!

595
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,640
無茶だよ

596
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,830
The waves are choppy.

597
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,800
海は荒れてるし

598
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,180
ヨナなんか風に飛ばされちゃうよ

599
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,960
The wind could blow Yona away!

600
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,100
私が降りてお助けする

601
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,090
I'll go rescue her!

602
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,010
Wait!

603
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,260
お待ち

604
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,100
あの娘は私の信頼を得るために
この仕事を引き受けたんだよ

605
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,760
That girl accepted this job to earn my trust.

606
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,420
お前らはその覚悟を踏みにじる気かい

607
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,180
Are you willing to stomp all over her resolve?

608
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,460
しかし何があったら

609
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,680
But if something happened to her...

610
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,720
ヨナは女の子なんだよ

611
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,310
Yona is a girl!

612
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,300
女だって戦わなければならない時があるんだ

613
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,060
Sometimes, women must fight too.

614
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,880
舐めるんじゃないよ

615
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,820
Don't underestimate us.

616
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,280
Hak, are you all right with this?

617
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,780
ハク そなたはよいのか

618
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,100
ハク

619
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,990
Hak!

620
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,840
ヨナ

621
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,740
Yona...

622
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,160
ヨナ

623
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,130
Yona!

624
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,560
もう バカ バカ

625
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,590
Geez, you idiot!

626
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
無茶ばっかり

627
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,050
You're always so reckless!

628
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,420
ごめんなさい

629
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,590
I'm sorry.

630
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,970
Where is the senjuso?

631
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,100
千樹草は

632
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
ここに

633
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,430
Here.

634
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,930
So it is.

635
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,100
確かに

636
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,790
じゃ約束通りお前を

637
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,730
Then, as promised, you-

638
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,400
No.

639
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,720
いいえ

640
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,940
Jae-ha helped me.

641
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,830
私 ジェハに助けてもらいました

642
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,360
突然の大波に海に投げ出されそうになって 助けてもらったの

643
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,450
A sudden wave nearly carried me out to sea, and he saved me.

644
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,330
I couldn't do it alone.

645
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,970
私一人の力じゃ なしえなかった

646
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,280
では 諦めるんだね

647
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,250
Then you're giving up?

648
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,760
いいえ

649
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,790
No.

650
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
もう一度 一人で取ってくる

651
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,540
I'm going to get it myself this time.

652
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,790
She's great...

653
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,790

She's great...

676
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,290
She's great...

677
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,290
She's great...

678
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,340
She's great...

679
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,340

1106
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,120
Currently 25 Years Old

1107
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:39,620
She was so determined to keep going, I thought I'd lose years off my life.

1108
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,600
彼女があまりに必死で引き下がらないから 寿命が縮む思いだったよ

1109
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,860
随分入れ込んでんな

1110
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
You're pretty deeply engaged in this.

1111
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,400
僕は女の子にはいつだって入れ込むよ

1112
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,000
When it comes to girls,
I'm always deeply engaged.

1113
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,510
However, I've never met anyone like her.

1114
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,280
でも あんな子は初めてだ

1115
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,100
純粋で頑固で そのくせ足元はふらふらで

1116
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,590
If you must touch her, at least wash your hands first!

1117
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,090
She's pure and stubborn,
but unsteady on her feet.

1118
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,470
Who do you think you are?

1119
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,180
I'd consider her a huge pain in the ass.

1120
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,400
僕にとっては非常に厄介でめんどくさい

1121
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,010
I am clean as the purest white.

1122
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,310
See?! This happened because you touched her!

1123
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,350
I can't understand why anyone
would want to protect her.

1124
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,400
護衛する奴の気が知れないね

1125
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,120
まぁな

1126
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,810
I guess...

1127
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,760
よっぽと大切なんだね

1128
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,820
She must be really important.

1129
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,880
まっ 幼馴染だし

1130
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
Well, we're old friends.

1131
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,300
恋人

1132
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,360
Lovers?

1133
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,460
まさか

1134
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,320
Yeah, right.

1135
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,660
大事な 預かりもんだ

1136
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,200
She's an important person left in my care.

1137
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,760
預かりものね

1138
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,740
Left in your care, huh?

1139
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,990
What?

1140
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,920
なんだよ

1141
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,980
なんとなく 君と彼女は近いようでいて
距離があるなと思ってさ

1142
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:24,920
I get the impression you're very close,
but there's some distance between you.

1143
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,420
Huh?

1144
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,010
Maybe it's because you don't really want her.

1145
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,200
それって君が彼女を本気で欲しいと思ってないあらかな

1146
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,040
でっかいお世話だ

1147
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,010
Mind your own business.

1148
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,800
Why would you say that?

1149
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,760
なんでてめぇがそんなこと

1150
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,820
なんでかなぁ

1151
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,930
Why, indeed?

1152
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,060
彼女に興味を持ったからかも

1153
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,850
Maybe it's because I'm interested in her.

1154
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,190
Just kidding.

1155
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,210
うそ

1156
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,820
今のハクの顔 面白かったよ

1157
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,980
That was an interesting face you just made.

1158
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,920
ちょっと疲れが取れた

1159
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,730
I feel a bit rejuvenated.

1160
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,400
彼女を本気で欲しいと思ってないからかな

1161
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,410
Maybe it's because you don't really want her.

1162
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,340
知るか そんなこと

1163
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,290
Whatever...

1164
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,740
ずっと ずっと兄妹見たいに側にいて

1165
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,170
We've... We've been like siblings forever.

1166
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,060
彼奴と姫さんが治める国を守ろうと

1167
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,880
I lived every day sworn to protect the kingdom

1168
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,850
that he and the princess would rule together.

1169
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,840
それだけを誓って 日々を生きてきた

1170
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,560
今 なんとか生きようとしている姫さんに

1171
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,480
Now, the princess is just trying to survive.

1172
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,060
イル陛下からの大事な預かり者である姫さんに

1173
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,400
This princess left in my care by King Il...

1174
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,700
これ以上 望むとこなど

1175
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,650
There's nothing more I could ask of her.

1176
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,640
なに泣いてるんっすか

1177
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,660
What are you crying about?

1178
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,740
なん なんでもないわ

1179
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,570
N-Nothing.

1180
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,700
痛い痛い痛い

1181
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,410
Ow, ow, ow!

1182
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,320
なんだこりゃ

1183
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,420
What's this?

1184
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,760
千樹草取りに行ったときに木の棘がいっぱい刺さって

1185
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,750
I pricked myself on a lot of thorns when I went to pick the senjuso.

1186
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,340
I heard I could get them out with a needle.

1187
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,280
針で取るものだって聞いたから

1188
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,070
ぐりぐりと針で抉ってたわけですかい

1189
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,010
So you tore up your hands with a needle?

1190
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,320
凄く痛いのに取れないと

1191
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,350
It really hurt, but I couldn't get anything out!

1192
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,300
針は火で炙りましたか

1193
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,310
Did you heat the needle with a flame?

1194
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,560
Huh? Why would I do that?

1195
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,360
なにそれ

1196
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,720
大変だ

1197
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,730
This is terrible!

1198
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,920
傷口が化膿して明日には手が腐って落ちますよ

1199
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,940
Your wounds will fester, and tomorrow, your hands will rot off!

1200
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,190
Huh?!

1201
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,690
刺すわよ

1202
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,150
I'll stab you!

1203
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,650
In any case, clean your wounds.

1204
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,740
とりあえず 傷口を洗ってください

1205
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,820
Okay.

1206
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,900
ユンの荷物勝手に漁ったら怒られちゃうよ

1207
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,950
Yun will get mad at you for
digging through his things.

1208
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,640
緊急事態だ 仕方ない

1209
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,500
This is an emergency. I have no choice.

1210
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,380
あった

1211
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,290
Here it is.

1212
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,120
Is that honey?

1213
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,000
それ蜂蜜

1214
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,290
Huh? What are you doing?

1215
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,700
なにをするの

1216
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,800
これを患部に塗って しばらく置けば
自然に棘は出てきます

1217
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,710
If you leave it on the affected area for a while,

1218
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,920
the thorns will come out on their own.

1219
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,150
本当に

1220
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,050
Really?

1221
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,040
昔は爺によく針で抉られて

1222
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,970
The old man used to stab me
with needles all the time.

1223
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,100
When I learned there was an easier way to get them out, I wanted to kill him.

1224
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,920
こんな楽な方法があると知った時は殺意芽生えたね

1225
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
ムンドクらしいわ

1226
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,060
That sounds like Mun-deok.

1227
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,360
本当に

1228
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,690
I can't believe the way your hands look, Princess.

1229
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,820
なんて手してんですか お姫様が

1230
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,070
Do you think I've gotten stronger?

1231
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,100
私 少しは強くなれた？

1232
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,500
少しはハクに近づけたかな

1233
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,410
Am I closer to you now?

1234
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,870
You're very close, but there's
some distance between you.

1235
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,180
君と彼女は近いようで距離がある

1236
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,560
本気で欲しいと思ってないからかな

1237
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,420
Maybe it's because you don't really want her.

1238
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,060
うるせぇな たれ目

1239
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,000
Shut up, droopy eyes.

1240
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,510
You're probably right.

1241
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,360
多分 そうなんだろうよ

1242
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,150
そういつは今まで 何度も押し殺してきたんだから

1243
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,140
Up to now, I've suppressed my desire countless times.

1244
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,800
ハク

1245
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,010
Hak?

1246
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,680
蜂蜜垂れてる

1247
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,680
The honey is dripping!

1248
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,230
Huh?

1249
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,400
U-Um, H-Hak...

1250
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,740
あ あの ハ ハク

1251
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Ha...

1252
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,030
Hak!

1253
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,000
ハク

1254
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,000
もう...いい

1255
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,790
That's... enough.

1256
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,880
なにやってんだ 俺は

1257
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,790
What am I doing?

1258
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,860
姫さんが自由に生きる

1259
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,750
The princess can live freely.

1260
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,180
Be satisfied with that, you idiot.

1261
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,840
それで満足しとけ 馬鹿野郎

1262
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,350
I don't need desire making an appearance now.

1263
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,300
今更 欲なんて 顔を出してくれるなよ

1264
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,880
お前の取ってきた千樹草で
仲間の容態が回復に向かっているそうだ

1265
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,270
My men are recovering because of
the senjuso you brought.

1266
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,960
みんなお前に感謝してるってよ

1267
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,030
Everyone is grateful to you.

1268
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,530
I'm glad.

1269
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,880
よかった

1270
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,760
もう 犠牲を出してたくないからね

1271
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,570
I don't want to lose anyone else.

1272
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,840
亡くなった人がいるの

1273
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,780
Have you lost people?

1274
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,820
そりゃあね 海賊なんてやってんだ

1275
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,500
Of course. We are pirates.

1276
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,350
無傷ってわけにはいかないよ

1277
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,290
Injuries are part of our life.

1278
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,620
この戦いが終わったら 海賊を解散して

1279
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,420
Once this battle is over,
I want to disband my pirate crew,

1280
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,440
彼奴らを普通の生活に戻してやりたいんだ

1281
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,300
so they can return to living normal lives.

1282
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,760
そう...なの

1283
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,470
Really?

1284
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,240
一人だけ難しい奴がいるがね

1285
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,350
There's just one problem.

1286
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,800
難しい

1287
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,560
A problem?

1288
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,020
ジェハだよ

1289
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,980
Jae-ha.

1290
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,640
彼奴はこの船が家だからね

1291
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,480
This ship is his home.

1292
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,920
異形の存在故 ここが一番居心地よいのさ

1293
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,820
Because he's different,
he feels most comfortable here.

1294
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,200
Once the pirates disband,
will Jae-ha be alone?

1295
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,620
じゃ 海賊を解散したら ジェハは一人になるの

1296
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,460
お前が 連れてってくれるかい

1297
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,450
Would you take him with you?

1298
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,480
そうしたいけど 私と行くのは嫌だって

1299
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,250
I'd like to, but he doesn't want to go with me.

1300
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,040
Maybe he's not ready to leave the nest.

1301
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,860
彼奴はまだ親離れできないのかね

1302
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,110
心外だなぁ船長

1303
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,090
That's not true, Captain.

1304
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
僕は本来 一人が好きなんだよ

1305
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,180
I like being alone.

1306
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,780
海賊がなくなったって 気ままにやっていくさ

1307
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,430
Once the pirates are gone, I'll simply do as I please.

1308
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,800
それこそ 異形の龍達とつるんで何になるんだい

1309
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,430
What good will joining those other dragons do?

1310
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,940
ヨナちゃんと二人旅なら考えるけど

1311
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,730
But I'd consider traveling with only Yona.

1312
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,810
Oh, but I'm not interested in looking after a child.

1313
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
でも 子守はしんどいから

1314
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,560
もう少し大人の女性になったらね

1315
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,900
I'll join you once you're a little older.

1316
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:50,410
Crying tears for the days that won't return

1317
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:50,410
modoranai hibi ni namida koboshite

1318
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,390
ジェハは意地悪ね

1319
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,400
You're so mean, Jae-ha!

1320
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,670
ハクみたい

1321
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,780
You're just like Hak!

1322
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,740
Oh? Interesting.

1323
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:46,700

珍しいね

1402
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:59,880
You look up to the sky, and it's burning bright red

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,820
一体 なにが

1526
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,540

クムジは徐々に戦力を増やしつつある

1533
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,390
Kum-ji is strengthening his forces.

1534
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,700
それは恐らくクムジにとって一番大事な取引が近くに控えているから

1535
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:01,560
It's probably because his most
important deal is coming up.

Just with a group near Awa, actually.

They're one of Kum-ji's regular trading partners.

1544
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,790
What makes the deal so important?

1545
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,980
一番大事な取引というのは

1546
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,100
人身売買さ

1547
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,040
It's human trafficking.
