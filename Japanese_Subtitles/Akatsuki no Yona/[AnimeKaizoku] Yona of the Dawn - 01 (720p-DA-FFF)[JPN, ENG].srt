2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,680
ヨナ姫 そろそろ出発しましょう

3
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,830
Princess Yona, we must depart.

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,100
冷えるね ここは

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,130
It's cold here.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,530
山沿いですから

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,630
It does border the mountains.

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,970
あの頃は私 城の外がこんなに寒いって事 知らなかった

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,180
Back then, I had no idea it was so cold outside the castle.

10
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,280
This is the Kingdom of Kouka,
and that was once my castle.

11
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,150
ここは高華王国 そして嘗ても私の城

12
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,700
緋龍城は当時 王の他には

13
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,370
At the time, the king lived in Hiryuu Castle with no male heir, nor any queen to bear him one.

14
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,010
世継ぎの王子も 世継ぎを産む妃もなく

15
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,790
ただ 齢十五の王女だけが 大切に育てられていた

16
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,120
Only his beloved fifteen-year-old daughter was raised there.

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,040
This is the tenth year since the death of my father, the former king Ju-nam.

18
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,900
我が父君 先王ジュウナムが崩御し 今年で十年

19

Episode 1:   The Princess Yona

20
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,590
Episode 1:   The Princess Yona

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,300
Our Kingdom of Kouka is a small country surrounded by powerful nations

22
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:40,400
この高華王国は南北を強大な他国に挟まれ
数多の戦乱に巻き込まれた小国

23
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,300
to the north and south, involving us in many wars.

24
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,760
However, thankfully, the last ten years have passed with no significant battles,

25
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,940
姫様は

26
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,930
Where's the princess?

27
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,100
Apparently she's still getting ready.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
それがまだお仕度中でして

29
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,600
I see... because he's coming today.

30
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,450
そうか 彼奴が来る日だしな

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,680
and to this day, we have enjoyed prosperity in this land.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,600
She's such a child.

33
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,720
ガキか

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,560
My daughter, Yona, will soon be sixteen years old.

35
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,540
間もなく我が娘 ヨナも 十六となる

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,610
I pray that under the divine protection of Hiryuu, the king of old,

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,670
願わくば 古の緋龍王の加護により
皆の平安が永久に続かむこと

38
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,860
the peace in this country will last for all eternity!

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,450
Long live King Il!

40
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,600
よくお似合いですよ 姫様

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,580
You look wonderful, Princess.

42
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,960
Forgive me, but you should proceed to the courtyard soon.

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,890
あの そろそろ中庭の方に

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
No! This won't do.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,790
駄目 何か違う

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Hey, where's that chintz?

47
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,810
ね あの更紗どこにあったかしら

48
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,970
Father! What about the ceremony?

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,940
お父様 式典は

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,430
As you can see, it's over.

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,370
見ての通り 終わったよ

52
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,470
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I...

53
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,340
嘘 ごめんなさい 私...

54
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,940
Well, no matter. It was merely a formality.

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,950
まぁよい 何の道 形式的な物

56
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,440
You don't need to appear before the people.

57
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,570
お前が人前に出る必要はないさ

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,690
Um, Father, isn't there something odd about my hair?

59
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,840
ね 父上 私の髪 変じゃない

60
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,110
Of course not! Your beauty surpasses that of any jewel-

61
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,480
変じゃないとも ヨナの美しさはどんな宝石も敵わん...

62
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,320
Yes, my face does.

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,980
顔はね 私もそこそこ可愛く生まれたと思うわ

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,030
I believe I was born with quite a cute face.

65
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,210
But why is my hair so red and unruly?

66
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,180
でもね この髪 どうしてこう赤毛で癖毛なのかしら

67
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,710
Grr! It won't behave at all!

68
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,100
ムギー ちっとも纏まらない...纏まらない

69
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,710
That isn't true. Right, Hak?

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,720

ええ イル陛下

229
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,590
Who would ever say that
the princess's hair looks strange?

230
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,400
姫様の御髪が変などと だれが申しましょうか

231
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,640
If anything isn't right,

232
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,510
敢えて申し上げるなら 脳みそが変ですね

233
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,600
it would be her brain.

234
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,640
Quiet, knave!

235
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,780
お黙り 下僕

236
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,230
Father, do something about this impertinent cretin!

237
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,280
父上 こいつ何とかして 態度でかすぎ

238
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,730
Now, now. Hak has been your friend since childhood.

239
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,850
まぁまぁ ハクはお前の幼馴染だろう

240
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,170
それに この城を守る五人の将軍の一人

241
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,240
Moreover, he's one of the five generals who protect this castle.

242
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
He is the Wind Tribe's-

243
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,420
風の部族を...

244
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,700
I don't care! If you need guards, pick someone more lovable!

245
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,070
そんなの知らない 護衛ならもっと可愛げのある人がいい

246
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,240
Speaking of lovable...

247
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,650
可愛いと言えば いいんですか 可愛くしとかなくて

248
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,450
shouldn't you be trying to look lovable yourself?

249
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,870
Huh?

250
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,370
It seems Lord Su-won has arrived.

251
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,760
お着きになられたようですよ スウォン様

252
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,460
Y-You should have told me sooner!

253
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800
そっ それは早く言いなさい

254
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,840
Su-won? Is that why you were concerned about your hair?

255
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,300
スウォン？ だから髪を気にしていたのですか

256
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,590
But why now?

257
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,880
しかしなぜ今更

258
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,680
It must be that thing they call a "maiden heart."

259
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,450
乙女心って奴じゃないですか

260
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,260
姫様

261
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,720
Princess!

262
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,970
Su-won...

263
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,520
スウォン

264
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,970
Su-won!

265
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,730
スウォン

266
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,230
Kind Su-won, who has been by my side since we were children...

267
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,300
小さい頃から いつも私の側に居て 優しかったスウォン

268
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,650
My cousin, three years my senior!

269
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,590
三つ年上の私の従兄弟

270
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,320
For the first time in so long, today I get to...

271
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,530
今日は久々にスウォンに...

272
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,650
Whoa, there.

273
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,370

274
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,850
会えた

275
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,700
You're as energetic as ever, Princess Yona.

相変わらず元気ですね ヨナ姫

277
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,540
Why the rush?

278
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
どうしたんです 慌てて

279
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,790
I-I heard you had arrived,
so I came to meet you.

280
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,030

819

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,090
あっ そうだ 私がヨナの母上になります

821
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,580
First of all, you need to eat.

822
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,320
とりあえず食事はしなきゃ

823
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,210

1174

取って置きのお菓子があるのよ

1176

1177
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,950
一緒に...って

1178
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,050
What's the matter, Yona?

1179
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,070
どうした ヨナ

1180
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,840
If you're looking for Lord Su-won,
he's with General Hak.

1181
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,480
スウォン様でしたら ハク将軍と一緒に

1182
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,120
ハク狡い

1183
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,270
No fair, Hak!

1184
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,230
How could you set me aside
and have fun with Su-won?

1185
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,130
この私を差し置いてスウォンと遊ぶ何て

1186
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,230
Now, now. They haven't seen one another in some time, you know.

1187
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,840
まぁまぁ あの二人も久々に会ったんだし

1188
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,080
さすがですね ハク

1189
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,170
Well done, Hak.

1190
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,210
You were magnificent yourself, Lord Su-won.

1191
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,210
スウォン様こそ お見事です

1192
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,090
Next time, I'll strike dead center as well.

1193
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,260
次は私も 真ん中だ

1194
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,220
I'm going to do archery with Su-won too!

1195
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,350
私もスウォンと弓やる

1196
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,350
No! You mustn't handle weapons!

1197
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,250
ダメだダメだ武器など

1198
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,520
I don't even want to let those two use them.

1199
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,360
あの二人にだって持たせたくない位なのに

1200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Then you do it!

1201
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,370
じゃ父上やってよ

1202
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,310
But I'd get hurt.

1203
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,130
怪我しちゃうじゃないか

1204
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,490
まぁ臆病 大体父上はね...

1205
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,650
You coward! You know, you're just...

1206
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,290
ヨナ

1207
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,730
Yona!

1208
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,690
Come down. I'll let you ride with me.

1209
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,560
いらっしゃい 馬に乗せてあげます

1210
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,780
Okay!

1211
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,740
Su-won!

1212
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,590
スウォン

1213
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,290
Relax. We'll both hold on to you.

1214
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,190
落ち着いて 二人で支えますから

1215
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,410
But...

1216
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,130
でも...

1217
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,960
Hak is about to die under the weight of the princess.

1218
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,760
姫様の重みで 間もなくハクは絶命

1219
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,030
張り倒すわよ

1220
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,880
I'll beat you down!

1221
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,250
Don't worry. You love horses, don't you?

1222
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,940
大丈夫 馬 好きでしょう

1223
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,170
I do.

1224
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,480
好きよ

1225
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,130
I love you.

1226
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,040
大好き

1227
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,470
Entrust your body to me.

1228
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,180
私に体を預けていなさい

1229
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,350
His voice... His breath...

1230
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,220
声が...息が...

1231
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,980
When he was a child,
he was cute like a little girl.

1232
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,750
子供の頃は女の子見たいに可愛かったのに

1233
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,520
これは反則じゃない

1234
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,730
Isn't this against the rules?

1235
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,230
Huh?

1236
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,690
I mean, you seem to be accustomed
to dealing with women.

1237
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,390
あぁっいえ... スウォンって女性の扱い慣れてる感じ

1238
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,240
I bet you bring lots of women into your mansion.

1239
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,460
案外お屋敷では山ほど女性を連れ込んでたりして...

1240
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,410
Gosh, what am I saying?

1241
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,160
あらあら何言い出すの私は

1242
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,000
まさか...

1243
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,290
I'm right?!

1244
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,370
Please! You're mistaken.

1245
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,890
嫌だな 誤解ですよ

1246
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,250
There have been a few discussions of engagements, but...

1247
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,120
確かに縁談の話は幾つがありますが

1248
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,340
Engagements?!

1249
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,220
縁談？！

1250
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,900
いや 別にまだ決まっった訳では

1251
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,960
Oh, but nothing is decided yet.

1252
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,220
Let's not talk about this, okay?

1253
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,960
もう 止めません この話

1254
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,320
ヨナに言っても仕方ないですし

1255
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,470
There's no need to trouble you with such things.

1256
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,180
He's treating me like a child again.

1257
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,780
また子供扱い

1258
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,140
I-I've had proposals too!

1259
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,050
わっ...私にだって縁談くらいあるわ

1260
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,020
What? From whom?

1261
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,720
え 誰と

1262
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,260
ハクとか

1263
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,480
Hak, for one!

1264
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,710
バカ 寄りによってハクの名前は出る何てバレバレの見栄を

1265
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,900
Idiot! Of all the names to give him,
Hak makes it too obvious!

1266
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,010
だって仕方ないじゃない
年の近い男何て此奴しか知らないもの

1267
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,200
I can't help it! I don't know
any other men near my age!

1268
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,480
だから思いっ切り不審な目で見るのは止めてそこの従者

1269
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,320
So stop giving me that suspicious look, you servant!

1270
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,080
Um, I meant...

1271
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,500
あの...今

1272
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,740
いいんじゃないかなぁ

1273
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,700
I think that sounds nice.

1274
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,040
Congratulations!

1275
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,910
おめでとうございます

1276
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,710
You're cruel!

1277
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,760
酷い

1278
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,880
You're too cruel, Su-won!
How could you believe that lie?!

1279
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,390
あんまりよスウォン あんな嘘を信じる何て

1280
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,420
You're the cruel one. You're also a nuisance.

1281
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,560
酷いのはあんただ そして迷惑だ

1282
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,180
Your marriage may not be a lie after all.

1283
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,010
お前の結婚は嘘にならんかもしれんぞ

1284
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,800
Huh?

1285
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,470
It would only be natural for you
to be betrothed by now.

1286
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,390
そろそろ婚約者が居ても おかしくはないだろう

1287
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:23,960
いや

1288
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,140
No...

1289
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,980
嫌よ 私はスウォンが...

1290
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,140
No! I want Su-won to-

1291
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,370
スウォンはダメだ

1292
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,730
You can't have Su-won!

1293
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,940
Princess...

1294
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,090
姫様

1295
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,270
I won't let you dictate my love life! I'm-

1296
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,570
父上に私の恋愛をとやかく言われたくないわ 私は...

1297
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:39,200
Yona, I have always given you anything you desired.

1298
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,610
ヨナ 私はこれまでお前が望む物は何でも与えてきたよ

1299
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,870
Beautiful hair ornaments, earrings,

1300
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,720
美しい簪に耳飾り

1301
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,650
離宮に花の庭園

1302
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,330
a royal villa and a flower garden...

1303
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,950
I'd give you anything that isn't a weapon.

1304
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,680
武器以外の物は何でも

1305
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,330
しかしお前がどれだけ望んでも
スウォンを与える事だけは出来ない

1306
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:53,460
But no matter how you wish it,
I can't give you Su-won.

1307
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,390
お前は高華王国の王女

1308
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,760
You are the princess of the Kingdom of Kouka.

1309
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,570
お前の夫となる者は この国の王となる者なのだ

1310
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,800
The man who marries you
will become the next king.

1311
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,090
スウォンは父上の兄 ユホン叔伯父上の息子

1312
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,330
Su-won is the son of your brother, Yu-hon.

1313
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,910
He's of royal blood.

1314
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,740
王家の血筋でしょう

1315
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,460
True, but it is my duty and right
as king to choose my heir.

1316
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,470
そうだな だが後継者は王である私が選ぶ

1317
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,790
Why not him? Su-won is a fine man.

1318
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,420
どうして スウォンは立派な人よ

1319
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,130
You're a cowardly king who's too
afraid to touch a weapon.

1320
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,100
父上は武器を恐れて触れもしない 臆病の王様じゃない

1321
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,680
I am indeed a cowardly king.

1322
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,960
確かに臆病な王だよ 私は

1323
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,600
Your mother was captured and killed by insurgents.

1324
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,660
お前の母は賊に襲われ殺された

1325
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,810
Such dangers go hand in hand with being part of a king's family.

1326
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,300
王の一族にはこの様な危険が付き纏う

1327
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,560
That is why I have had no desire to take a new wife.

1328
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,610
それ故 私は再び妻を娶る気になれなかったよ

1329
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,570
Yona, you want Su-won to be happy, don't you?

1330
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,310
ヨナ スウォンには幸せになって欲しいだろう

1331
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,240
I don't understand.

1332
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,760
分からない

1333
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I don't understand, Father.

1334
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,390
分からないわ 父上

1335
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,860
だってそれなら 私の夫となる人は不幸になってもいいの

1336
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:12,040
Does that mean it's all right for the man I marry to meet with misfortune?

1337
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
私は幸せになってはいけないの

1338
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,920
Am I not allowed to be happy?

1339
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,630
でもそうよね 例え父上は許しても

1340
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,800
But it's true. Even if Father allowed it,

1341
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,290
スウォンにとって私はずっと子供の頃のまんま

1342
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,760
in Su-won's eyes, I'm still the same child I was back then.

1343
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,100
Su-won and I were never meant to be.

1344
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,120
ダメじゃない 最初からスウォンと私は...

1345
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,730
Who's there?

1346
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,420
だれ

1347
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,560
Hak? It's you again, isn't it?

1348
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,600
ハク またハクでしょう

1349
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,280
Only you would do something so senseless.

1350
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,120
そんな下らない事して

1351
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,610
No. It can't be!

1352
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,130
まさか...そんな

1353
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,660
Your mother was captured and killed by insurgents.

1354
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,530
お前の母は 賊に襲われ殺された

1355
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,790
No!

1356
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,380
No!

1357
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,260
いや

1358
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,090
Help! Someone... Someone!

1359
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,960
助けて だれか だれか

1360
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,350
Su-won!

1361
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,490
スウォン

1362
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,290
ヨナ

1363
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,640
Yona?

1364
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,480
Su-won...

1365
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,330
スウォン

1366
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm sorry. Did I frighten you?

1367
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,410
すみません びっくりさせちゃいました

1368
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,940
I didn't know it was you.

1369
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,710
急に入って来るものだから

1370
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,320
Yona?

1371
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:22,860
ヨナ

1372
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,610
A s-strange man came after me.

1373
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,420
へ...変な人が私を...

1374
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,870
There's no one there.

1375
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,830
だれも居ませんよ

1376
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,620
That can't be! I...

1377
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,490
嘘 だって...

1378
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,960
逃げたんだ

1379
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,710
He ran away.

1380
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,830
A castle guard would have said something.

1381
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,700
城の衛兵なら 普通に声をかけるもの

1382
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,130
Yona?

1383
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,000
ヨナ

1384
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,340
Was he targeting me? Because I'm the king's daughter?

1385
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,870
私を狙った 私が王の娘だから

1386
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,170
Yona.

1387
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,950
ヨナ

1388
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,140
It's all right. I'm here.

1389
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,920
大丈夫 私が居ます

1390
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,760
Su-won...

1391
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,700
スウォン

1392
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,530
ダメ 私 スウォンとは居られない

1393
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,600
No. I can't be with you.

1394
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Why not?

1395
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,490
どうして

1396
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,980
Because...

1397
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,910
だって

1398
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,980
If you stay with me, you'll be in danger.

1399
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,690
私と居ると 貴方まで危ない目に

1400
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,490
If you'd rather be with Hak,
I'll take you to his quarters.

1401
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,240
ハクの側がいいなら 彼の部屋が送ってあげますよ

1402
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,330
He's your betrothed, isn't he?

1403
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,440
だって 婚約者なんでしょう

1404
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,000
That's not...

1405
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,500
違う

1406
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,370
You don't need to hide it.

1407
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,120
隠さなくても

1408
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,590
Hak would be angry if he knew the two of us were alone here.

1409
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,460
ハクに怒られちゃいますね
こんな所に二人ってきりだ何て

1410
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,830
いや スウォン 違うの

1411
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,340
No... Su-won, that's not it.

1412
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,340
You don't have to return my feelings. Still...

1413
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,850
振り向いてくれなくてもいいから だから...

1414
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,010
私はスウォンの事がずっと...

1415
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,140
Su-won, I've always...

1416
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,410
思っても いいでしょう

1417
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,890
I can love you, can't I?

1418
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,150
It looks like the rain's letting up.

1419
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,020
雨が少し小降りになったみたいですよ

1420
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,650
He ignored me?

1421
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,520
無視...した

1422
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,700
Let me walk you to your room. I'll call a guard.

1423
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,560
部屋まで送ってあげます 護衛を付きましょう

1424
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,990
ス スウォン 私...

1425
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,120
S-Su-won, I...

1426
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,290
I'm sorry. Please don't come close to me.

1427
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,960
すみません 側に寄らないでください

1428
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,120
勘違いしそうになる

1429
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,250
I may make a mistake.

1430
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,550
What?

1431
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,760
That is, a moment ago, it sounded as if you were saying that you...

1432
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,520
つまり...ですり さっきの流れたとまるで まるでヨナが私を...

1433
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,510
And if that weren't a mistake?

1434
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,520
勘違いじゃなかったら

1435
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,270
If it weren't a mistake, would that upset you?

1436
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,330
勘違いじゃなかったら スウォンは嫌？

1437
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,230
I can't let this happen.

1438
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,990
困ります

1439
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,400
I can't let myself see you as a woman.

1440
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,410
あなたが急に女性に見えて困ります

1441
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,070
What was I until now, then?

1442
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,920
今までは何だったのよ

1443
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,120
Huh? Oh, well, a younger sister, perhaps?

1444
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,010
え えいや えっと 妹みたいな...

1445
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,310
知ってたわよ

1446
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,450
I knew that!

1447
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,370
R-Right.

1448
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,600
はい

1449
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:46,420
I'm sorry. I'm unfamiliar with things like this.

1450
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,220
すみません どうも私はこの手の事に疎くて

1451
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,880
Su-won is turning red.

1452
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,750
スウォン 真っ赤だ

1453
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,380
So you lied about your engagement?

1454
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,070
嘘ね 縁談は

1455
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,120
あれは そう言う話もあるって事で

1456
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,680
I just meant that discussions
about it have occurred.

1457
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,890
今はまだ

1458
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,270
I'm not engaged yet.

1459
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,980
Su-won, do you see me as a woman now?

1460
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,000
スウォン 私 女性に見える

1461
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:08,320
At least, I couldn't sleep holding
hands with you anymore.

1462
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,740
少なくとも 手を握って一緒に眠る何て もう出来ません

1463
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,860
My nerves would prevent me from sleeping.

1464
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,850
緊張で目が冴えてしまう

1465
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,570
Well, that's fine.

1466
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,480
まぁ いいや

1467
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,490
If you've given me even the slightest consideration,

1468
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,340
スウォンが私の事 少しでも気にしてくれたら

1469
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,160
that's enough for now.

1470
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,740
今はそれだけでいい

1471
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,910
Yona...

1472
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,710
ヨナ

1473
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,630
Father, I really love Su-won.

1474
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,450
父上 私やっぱりスウォンが好き

1475
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,170
I don't know anything about the kingdom or kings yet.

1476
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,080
国とか王とかまだ分からない

1477
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,500
でも父上 彼が居るだけで 私は最高に幸せなのよ

1478
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,760
Still, Father, just being by his side
is my greatest happiness.

1479
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,940
Five days later,

1480
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,800
五日後

1481
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,730
緋龍城では十六になる私の誕生祝いの宴が行われた

1482
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,860
a banquet to celebrate my sixteenth birthday was held in Hiryuu Castle.

1483
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,700
Princess, we wish you a happy birthday.

1484
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,630
姫様 お誕生日 おめでとうございます

1485
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,360
ありがとう

1486
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,490
Thank you!

1487
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,780
Sixteen years old.

1488
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,330
十六か

1489
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,110
ヨナも立派になったな

1490
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,240
How my Yona has grown!

1491
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,870
はい

1492
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,410
Yes.

1493
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,120
Yona!

1494
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,980
ヨナ

1495
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,420
Father, my hair still won't lay flat!
I wanted to wear it up today!

1496
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,020
父上

1497
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,280
やっぱり髪が跳ねるのよ 今日は結い上げたかったのに

1498
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,680
ダメだ 髪の事しか頭にない

1499
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,710
It's hopeless. All she thinks about is her hair.

1500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,790
スウォン

1501
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,920
Su-won!

1502
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,180
Yona!

1503
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,920
ヨナ

1504
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,110
陛下 宜しければ

1505
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,270
Your Majesty, if you'd like...

1506
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,100
ありがとう ミンス

1507
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,560
Thank you, Min-su.

1508
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,570
な 何か用

1509
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,810
I-Is there something you need?

1510
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,810
Give me your hand.

1511
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,710
手を出して下さい

1512
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,480
A hair ornament?

1513
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,350
簪？

1514
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,400
I'm sorry to bring you out here.

1515
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,240
すみません こんな所で

1516
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,620
I thought it would suit you, so I wanted to give it to you personally.

1517
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,410
ヨナに似合うと思って 手渡したかったんです

1518
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,740
My hair...

1519
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,640
私の髪...

1520
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,120
is red and unruly, and it won't behave at all.

1521
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,460
癖毛で赤毛で ちっとも纏まらないのよ

1522
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,710
This wouldn't look right on me.

1523
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,870
私には似合わないわ

1524
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,750
What?

1525
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,670
But I love your hair, Yona.

1526
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,760
私は好きですよ ヨナの髪

1527
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,430
It's a beautiful red, like the sky at dawn.

1528
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,880
綺麗な赤 暁の空の色です

1529
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,600
How simple am I?

1530
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,570
何て単純

1531
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,850
Just like that, I suddenly love my own hair.

1532
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,650
一瞬にして 自分の髪が愛おしくなるなんて

1533
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,100
Hak?!

1534
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,970
ハク

1535
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,690
His Majesty is looking for you.

1536
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,510
陛下が探してましたよ

1537
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,860
そう 部屋で休んでると伝えておいて

1538
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,070
Is he? Tell him I'm resting in my room.

1539
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,660
まぁ こんな事だろうと思ってました

1540
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,780
Well, I figured this is what was going on.

1541
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,370
Huh?

1542
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,990
I am sure you could persuade
the king, Lord Su-won.

1543
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,850
スウォン様なら 陛下を説得出来るでしょう

1544
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,950
You misunderstand, Hak.

1545
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,530
誤解ですよ ハク

1546
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,540
And would you stop speaking so formally?

1547
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,130
それに 敬語 止めません

1548
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,250
Just call me Su-won, like you used to.

1549
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,190
昔みたいにスウォンって呼んでいいのに

1550
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,260
I am well aware of my place.

1551
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,880
身分は弁えてますから

1552
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,260
More importantly, don't you sense something?

1553
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,250
それより 何か感じませんか

1554
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,180
I can't place it clearly, but something feels off,

1555
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,570
はっきりとは言えないけど 妙な違和感

1556
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,620
城に何か入り込んだ様な

1557
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,720
like something has made its way into the castle.

1558
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,140
Now that you mention it,
Yona said something similar.

1559
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,030
そう言えば ヨナもそんな事を言っていました

1560
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,760
何

1561
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,270
What?

1562
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,070
It may be wise to keep an eye on those entering and leaving today.

1563
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,060
今日出入りする人間を見張った方がいいかもしれませんね

1564
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,610
Understood. I will increase security in the courtyard.

1565
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,450
了解 俺は庭の警備を固めます

1566
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,300
スウォン様は姫の所へ

1567
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,530
Please stay with the princess.

1568
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,170
好きだと言った スウォンが私の髪を

1569
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,750
Su-won said he loved my hair.

1570
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,590
No matter how you wish it,
I cannot give you Su-won.

1571
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,340
お前がどれだけ望んでも
スウォンを与える事だけは出来ない

1572
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,510
I need to discuss it with Father once more.

1573
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,360
やっぱりもう一度 父上にきちんと話そう

1574
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,710
私はスウォンを忘れられない

1575
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,840
I can't forget about Su-won.

1576
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm sure Father will understand.

1577
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,470
父上もきっと分かってくれるわ

1578
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,890
The door is...

1579
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,160
入口が

1580
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,270
How careless, not posting guards here.

1581
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,140
衛兵も置かずに不用心ね

1582
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,360
そう言えばどうして衛兵が一人も居ないの

1583
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,900
Come to think of it, why are there no guards?

1584
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,110
I didn't see a single one on my way here.

1585
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,980
ここに来るまで一人も見なかった

1586
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,530
Father?

1587
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,640
父上

1588
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,840
F-Father!

1589
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,710
ち 父上

1590
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,710
あ まだ起きていたのでうか

1591
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,510
Oh, you were still awake,

1592
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,060
Princess Yona?

1593
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,870
ヨナ姫

1594
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,770
S-Su-won... Quickly, call a doctor.

1595
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,600
ス スウォン 早く医務官を

1596
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,870
イル陛下はもう目を開けません

1597
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,360
King Il will not wake again.

1598
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,860
I killed him.

1599
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,730
私が殺しました

1600
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,330
It's too quiet.

1601
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,170
やけに静かだ

1602
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,370
General Hak!

1603
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,510
ハク将軍

1604
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,750
You must be tired from your patrol.

1605
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,270
見回りご苦労様です

1606
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,750
さすがミンス 気が利くな

1607
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,710
As always, you're so considerate, Min-su.

1608
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,170
But are you sure you shouldn't be with the princess?

1609
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,090
でもいいんですか
ヨナ姫様の側にいて差し上げなくて

1610
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,130
Oh, I couldn't interfere.

1611
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,790
姫さんにはスウォン様がついてるからな

1612
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,930
The princess is with Lord Su-won.

1613
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,590
では ついに姫様のお心がスウォン様に

1614
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,850
Then, the princess's feelings have finally reached Lord Su-won?

1615
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,560
さぁな でも時間の問題だろう

1616
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,520
Who knows? But I'm sure it's a matter of time.

1617
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,230
ハク様はお二人の事をよくご存知ですものね

1618
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,230
You know the two of them well, don't you?

1619
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,980
I've been watching them for a long time.

1620
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,710
見てたからな 昔から

1621
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,990
I just... Well, how should I put it?

1622
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,730
あの二人には まぁ なんっつか

1623
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,660
I want them both to be happy.

1624
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,330
幸せになって欲しいと思ってる

1625
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,850
お覚悟 姫様

1626
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,990
Prepare yourself, Princess.

1627
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,000
This is all for the sake of the Kingdom of Kouka.

1628
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,870
これも高華國のためなんです

1629
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,630
I've loved no one but Su-won since we were children.

1630
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,520
幼い頃からずっと...ずっとスウォン だけだったのに

1631
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,170
Su-won!

1632
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,040
スウォン

1633
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,690
これは一体どう言う事ですか

1634
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,820
What is the meaning of this...

1635
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,450
Lord Su-won?

1636
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,320
スウォン 様

1637
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720
Do you see

1638
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720
