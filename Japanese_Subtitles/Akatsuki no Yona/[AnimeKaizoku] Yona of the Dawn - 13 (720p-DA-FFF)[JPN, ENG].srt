1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,400
今日はやけに目が疼く

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,440
My eyes are throbbing with pain
more than usual today.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,950
侵入者

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,820
Intruders?

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,450
A small and weak female voice.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,070
地下に閉じ込める気だ

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,870
They intend to trap her underground.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,440
ダメだ

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,200
They mustn't.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,600
四龍の戦士よ

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,630
Warriors of the four dragons...

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,820
なんだ

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,510
What is this?

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,090
これより お前達は我々の分身

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,890
You are now our other halves.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:46,570
緋龍を主とし 命の限り これを守り
これを愛し 決して裏切るな

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,390
You will serve Hiryuu as your master, protecting him with your lives.

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,690
You will love him and never betray him.

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,630
なんだ この声は

20
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,650
What is this voice?

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,650
目が疼く

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,870
My eyes are throbbing.

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,930
あの少女に触れた時 声が響いて

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,960
The moment I touched that girl,
a voice echoed through my head.

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,800
その場に崩れ落ちてしまいそうになった

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,880
I nearly collapsed where I stood.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,170
白い龍が居た

28
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,180
There was a white dragon.

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,030
どうして俺は 彼を白い龍だと思ってあんだろう

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,350
Why did I think he was a white dragon?

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,980
どうしてこんなに...

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,020
Why does it feel...

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,690
血が炊けるように熱い

34
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,600
like my blood is boiling?

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
My eyes are throbbing.

36
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,420
目が疼く

37
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,530
Be still.

38
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,800
静まれ

39
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,430
この力はもう二度と知られてはならないのだから

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,570
No one must learn of this power again.

43
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,330
A villager nearly took you below ground?!

44
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,550
里の人間に地下に連れて行かれそうになった

45
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,290
Yeah.

Not only do they refuse to respect you,
but they tried to trap you underground!

694
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,510
オノレ 姫様を敬わぬばかりか 地下に閉じ込めるなど

695
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,730
余程 私の逆鱗に触れたいらしいな

696
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,720
They must be determined to incur my wrath!

697
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,800
Ki-ja, your face!

698
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,420
キジャ 顔が

699
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,930
落ち着け

700
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,930
Calm down.

701
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,350
You're such a sheltered kid.

702
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,380
まったく坊ちゃん育ちは 一般人殺す気が

703
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,850
You want to kill common villagers? Grow up.

704
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,200
大人になれよ

705
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,900
You should grow up yourself, former general.

706
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,860
あんたもな 元将軍

707
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,490
But you're sure that man was the Blue Dragon?

708
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,420
けど さっきの彼奴が青龍だなんて 間違いないの

709
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,070
Yes.

710
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,110
だったらなんで逃げたんだ

711
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,240
Then why did he run away?

712
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,670
分からぬ

713
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,490
I don't know.

714
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,370
The Blue Dragon, the villagers...

715
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,210
青龍といい 里人といい

716
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,380
どうなっているのだここは

717
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,120
What's going on with this place?

718
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,290
同じ龍の里でも 白龍の里とは真逆ってことだね

719
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,710
They're both dragon villages,

720
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,340
but this one's the polar opposite of the White Dragon's village.

721
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,420
なに

722
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,000
What?

723
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,790
白龍の里を見てきたからここは異質に見えるけど

724
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,260
Because we saw the White Dragon's village first,
this village seems different.

725
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,870
考えてみたら 白龍の里が特別なのかも

726
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,050
But now that I think about it, maybe the White Dragon's village was the exception.

727
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,400
ここでは赤い髪への信仰はないし

728
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,520
These villagers don't revere red hair,

729
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,690
龍神の力を崇高なものともしていない

730
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,730
and they don't regard the dragon's power as exalted.

731
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,640
それどころか 忌まわしく思ってそうな節だってある

732
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,310
In fact, I get the feeling
they find it abominable.

733
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,430
村人にはもちろん

734
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:22,740
Not just the villagers, but the Blue Dragon himself,
may see us merely as intruders.

735
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,730
青龍にとっても俺等は本当に侵入者でしかないのかも

736
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,840
ばかな

737
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
That's ridiculous!

738
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,370
The four dragon warriors must hasten to join their master immediately.

739
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,440
四龍たるもの 主の元に一刻も早くはせ参じるものだ

740
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,750
Once I met the princess, I didn't hesitate,
up to and including the moment I left my village.

741
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,820
私は姫様に会って 里を出るまで
何も躊躇う事はなかったぞ

742
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,830
You don't hesitate enough.

743
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,800
あんたは迷いなさすぎ

744
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,870
当然

745
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,750
Of course not.

746
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,500
That wasn't a compliment.

747
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,570
いや 褒めてはいない

748
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,420
But he saved me.

749
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,400
でも 助けてくれたよ

750
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,430
The Blue Dragon had gentle hands.

751
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,510
青龍 優しい手をしていた

752
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,640
I want to speak with him.

753
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,620
会って話してたい

754
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,720
So you're going back into that maze?

755
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,520
つまりまた あの迷路に入るの

756
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,390
Yes.

757
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,090
怖い目にあったのに 全然怯まないのな

758
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,770
Even after that scary ordeal,
you're not fazed at all.

759
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,290
根性あるじゃん お姫様

760
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,270
You have guts, Princess.

761
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,020
行こう

762
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,780
Let's go.

763
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,980
あの行き止まりの場所になにかあるんだよね

764
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,780
There was something at that dead end, right?

765
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,670
姫さんはここにいろ

766
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,330
You stay here, Princess.

767
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,280
ハク

768
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,870
Hak?

769
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,590
Yun and I will find the Blue Dragon.

770
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,670
青龍は俺とユンで首根っこ引っ掴んでくるから

771
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,630
What are you saying? I'll go.

772
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,000
なにを言う 行くなら私だろう

773
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,710
Okay. We're counting on you, White Snake.

774
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,780
よし 任せた白蛇様

775
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,800
What?!

776
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,350
なに

777
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,300
In any case, don't go back in there, Princess.

778
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,050
とにかく 姫さんは もう中に入るな

779
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,190
外で待って

780
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,050
Wait outside and-

781
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,800
No.

782
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,020
いいえ

783
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,470
行くのは私とキジャよユン

784
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,270
Ki-ja, Yun, and I will go.

785
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,290
ハクはここで待ってて

786
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,890
You wait here, Hak.

787
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,260
キジャは青龍の場所がユンは道が分かる

788
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,190
Ki-ja can sense the Blue Dragon, and Yun's good with directions.

789
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,690
And I must meet the Blue Dragon.

790
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,670
そして 私が青龍に会わなきゃ

791
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,320
I believe I must do that myself.

792
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,350
それは 私の役目だと思うの

793
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,710
お願い

794
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,530
Please.

795
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,150
で だれかが外で里人を見張ってなきゃいけない

796
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,250
Well, someone has to stay outside and watch for the villagers.

797
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,750
それが余った俺ってわけですか

798
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,330
I'm the only one left, so I have to do it?

799
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,780
ハクだから任せるの

800
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,580
Because I know I can depend on you.

801
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,840
I'll be careful not to let anything
like that happen again.

802
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,740
さっきみたいな事にならないよう気を付けるから

803
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,670
ハク

804
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,880
Hak?

805
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,420
今度はちゃんと戻ってくださいよ

806
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,970
This time, come back.

807
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,460
でないと この先 うぜぇくらい側から離れませんからね

808
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,390
Otherwise, I'll stick annoyingly
close to you from now on.

809
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,180
ハク

810
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,060
Hak...

811
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,230
I avoid annoying things.

812
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
うざいのは嫌だ

813
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,980
だから気を付ける

814
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,190
So I'll be careful.

815
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,480
Yes, please do.

816
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,840
お そうして下さいよ

817
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,530
I pity him.

818
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,310
不愍

819
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,490
Hey, White Snake.

820
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,400
おい 白蛇

821
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,370
I'm not a white-

822
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,250
白蛇ではなっ...

823
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,930
頼む

824
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm counting on you.

825
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,060
言われずとも

826
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,250
Goes without saying.

827
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,710
見てる

828
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,640
They're watching.

829
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,390
ずっと監視してやがる

830
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,510
They've been observing us this whole time.

831
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,980
What a creepy bunch.

832
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,830
気味悪い連中だな

833
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,830
ま せいぜい威嚇してやるさ

834
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,940
I'll just have to intimidate them.

835
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,530
Princess, you're actually a bit scared
without the Thunder Beast, aren't you?

836
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,020
お姫様 本当は少し怖いでしょう

837
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,710
雷獣が居ないから

838
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,780
Yun, don't say that!

839
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,850
ユン言わないで

840
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,200
ハクが居ると 当たり前のように便り過ぎちゃうもの

841
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,660
When Hak's around, I rely on him too much.

842
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,350
頼られたいんじゃないの 雷獣は

843
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,040
Doesn't the Thunder Beast
want you to rely on him?

844
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,960
Yes, but Hak actually served
my late father, not me.

845
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,090
でも ハクは本当は私ではなく父上に仕えていたの

846
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,510
He's still following my father's orders.

847
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,580
今も父上の命令を守ってくれているのよ

848
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,260
I don't think that's the only reason.

849
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,330
それだけじゅあないと思うけど

850
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,470
Hak didn't like being a general or a bodyguard.

851
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,090
ハク 将軍とか護衛とか嫌がってたし

852
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,400
今はまだできないけど いつかは
ハクに自由を返したいと思う

853
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,060
I can't do it yet,

854
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,310
but someday, I'd like to set Hak free.

855
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,620
え ここの行き止まりに隠し通路

856
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,700
Huh? The dead end has a hidden passage?

857
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,610
Yes.

858
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,910
It's opening!

859
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,270
開いた開いた

860
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,410
How interesting!

861
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,730
面白い

862
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,150
キジャ 行くよ

863
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,170
Ki-ja, let's go.

864
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,470
どうしたの

865
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,460
What's wrong?

866
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,880
Ah, nothing.

867
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,090
あっ いえ

868
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,710
青龍はその先に居ます

869
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,750
The Blue Dragon is in there.

870
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,640
私はここで待っていますから

871
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,260
I'll wait out here.

872
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,070
お二人で行ってください

873
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,260
You two go ahead.

874
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,760
Huh? Why?

875
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,130
どうして

876
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,040
大丈夫

877
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,010
It's all right.

878
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,230
This handsome genius knows the way.

879
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,150
この天才美少年が道なら把握してるから

880
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,330
頼んだぞ

881
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,310
I'll depend on you.

882
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,150
Got it.

883
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,440
了解

884
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,840
さて

885
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,570
Now, then...

886
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,600
この狭き様な場所で何用だ

887
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,570
What do you want to do in this narrow space?

888
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,530
We cannot allow those who follow that path to leave.

889
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,500
その先へ行った者は帰すわけにはゆかない

890
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
黙れ

891
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,450
Quiet.

892
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,110
赤き龍の尊さをも忘れた不届き者とも

893
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,540
You are scoundrels who have forgotten the Red Dragon's nobility.

894
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,470
あのお方に近づく事 この白龍が許さぬ

895
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,710
I, the White Dragon, will not
allow you to approach her.

896
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,630
The White Dragon is nearby.

897
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,890
白い龍が近くに居る

898
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,600
Someone is walking through the passage.

899
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,820
誰か通路を渡っている

900
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,250
アオ 隠れて

901
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,430
Ao, hide.

1314
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,180
こんにちは

1315
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,920
Hello.

1316
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,580
なんだ

1317
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,210
What is this?

1318
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,130
此奴はなんなんだ

1319
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,300
Who is this person?

1320
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,810
やばいよ姫様

1321
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,930
This isn't good, Princess!

1322
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,180
こんな穴倉の奥で面付けて蹲ってるなんて

1323
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,310
A masked man crouching at the back of a hole like this must be dangerous!

1324
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,070
やっぱ危ない人だったんだよ

1325
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,320
It's you again.

1326
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,420
まだあった

1327
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,780
Huh?

1328
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,220
なにこの頬袋ぱんぱんの小動物

1329
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,240
What's this little creature with swollen cheeks?

1330
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,750
詰め込み過ぎたよ

1331
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,780
He's stuffed too much in there!

1332
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,330
この子何て言う名前

1333
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,120
What's his name?

1334
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,490
アオ

1335
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,580
Ao.

1336
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,040
答えてくれるんだ

1337
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,670
He answers questions?

1338
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,670
That name doesn't suit him at all.

1339
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,820
全然似合わないわね

1340
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,670
Try to meet him halfway, Princess!

1341
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,180
歩み寄ろうよお姫様

1342
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,890
似合わない

1343
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,590
It doesn't suit him.

1344
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,550
やっぱり

1345
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,590
I knew it.

1346
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,130
俺も そう思う

1347
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,970
I agree.

1348
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,530
私はヨナ あなたの名前は

1349
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,350
I'm Yona. What's your name?

1350
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,180
青...龍

1351
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,360
The Blue Dragon.

1352
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,840
あなたの名前よ

1353
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,730
No, your name.

1354
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,180
それは あなた自身の名ではないでしょう

1355
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,990
That isn't your name, is it?

1356
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,120
I don't have a name.

1357
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,470
名はない

1358
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,400
ただ 青龍だ

1359
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,330
I'm just the Blue Dragon.

1360
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,620
Stay back!

1361
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,890
寄るな

1362
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,110
お前達はなんだ

1363
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,130
Who are you people?

1364
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,090
なぜ この里に入ってくる

1365
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,590
Why have you entered this village?

1366
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,310
なぜ俺に近づく なぜあの白い龍は...

1367
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,890
Why are you approaching me?
Why is the White Dragon...

1368
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,130
私はあなたに会う為にここまで来たの

1369
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,060
I came here to see you.

1370
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,710
なぜ 俺はこんなにも...

1371
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Why do I feel so strongly...

1372
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,200
青龍 あなたの力を借りたいの

1373
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,900
Blue Dragon, I'd like you to lend me your power.

1374
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,000
私と一緒に来てほしい

1375
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,690
I want you to come with me.

1376
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,440
この少女に会いたかったと思うのだろう

1377
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,410
...that I've wanted to meet this girl?

1378
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,620
俺の...力

1379
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,380
My power...

1380
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,670
お姫様

1381
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,340
Princess!

1382
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,840
敵

1383
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,680
An enemy.

1384
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,800
青龍の力を欲する者は 敵

1385
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,430
Those who desire the power of the Blue Dragon are enemies!

1386
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,250
四龍の戦士達よ

1387
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,270
Warriors of the four dragons...

1388
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,000
お前達は我々の分身

1389
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,980
You are now our other halves.

1390
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,150
お前...

1391
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,240
You...

1392
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,240
Who are you?

1393
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,530
お前はなんだ

1394
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,310
なぜ 手が震える

1395
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,160
Why are my hands trembling?

1396
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,290
I don't know you.

1397
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,550
お前なんか知らない

1398
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,420
どうして

1399
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,170
Why?

1400
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,980
泣きたいのだろう

1401
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,130
Why do I want to cry?

1402
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,110
青龍 私は貴方の敵じゃないよ

1403
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,680
Blue Dragon, I am not your enemy.

1404
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,420
私は私と仲間が生きてゆく為に 四龍探しをしているの

1405
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,980
I am searching for the four dragons, so that my friends and I may live.

1406
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,360
貴方を仲間として迎えたい

1407
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,400
I want you to become my ally.

1408
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,400
Ally...

1409
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,920

Snooze

1634
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,490
どうしても

1635
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,520
No matter what?

1636
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,470
去れ

1637
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,310
Leave.

1638
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,100
Leave!

1639
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,380
去れ

1640
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,110
お姫様

1641
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,020
Princess...

1642
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,510
一つ言わせて

1643
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,450
Let me say one thing.

1644
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,280
貴方の手はとても暖かかった

1645
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,250
Your hand was very warm.

1646
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,240
呪いがどんなものかは知らない

1647
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,880
I don't know anything about your curse.

1648
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,040
でも あれが呪われた者の手だというなら

1649
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,340
But if that was the hand of a cursed man,

1650
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,180
貴方が恐ろしい呪いを持っていたって 私は全然構わない

1651
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,470
then I don't care, even if you do
bear a horrific curse.

1652
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,350
She's leaving.

1653
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,380
行ってしまう

1654
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,120
心臓が引きちぎられるようだ

1655
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,150
It feels as if my heart is being torn apart.

1656
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,280
I want you to become my ally.

1657
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,420
貴方を仲間として迎えたい

1658
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,530
Ally...

1659
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,220
仲間

1660
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,380
アオ

1661
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,830
Ao... I want friends.

1662
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,950
友達...欲しい

1663
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,750
そんな事 ずっと忘れていたのに

1664
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,680
For years... I had managed to avoid
thinking about that.

1665
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,040
お姫様

1666
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,470
Princess...

1667
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,470
You look really displeased.

1668
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,840
すっげ腑に落ちないって顔してるよ

1669
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,600
あの部屋 何もなかった

1670
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,270
There was nothing in that room.

1671
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,800
彼はちゃんと食べているのかしら

1672
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,440
Is he getting enough to eat?

1673
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,100
何だか 大切な人を暗い檻に置き去りにした気分

1674
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,030
I feel like I've left someone
very precious in a dark cage.

1675
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,980
変ね 初めて会ったのに

1676
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,990
It's strange. That was our
first meeting, and yet...

1677
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,040
Get back!

1678
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,200
下がる

1679
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,040
キジャ

1680
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,040
Ki-ja.

1681
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,960
They're back.

1682
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,150
出てきた

1683
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,840
出てきたぞ

1684
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,040
They came back.

1685
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,200
片づけろ

1686
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,130
Finish them.

1687
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,020
姫様 おさがりください

1688
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,710
Princess, stay back.

1689
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,980
やっぱりね

1690
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,300
I knew it.

1691
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,820
彼等は青龍を隠す為 我々を消すつもりです

1692
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,930
They intend to eliminate us,
to keep the Blue Dragon hidden.

1693
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,200
消す どうして

1694
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,720
Eliminate us? Why?

1695
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,940
Now that you know about him,
we can't let you leave here alive!

1696
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,310
彼奴の事を知られたからには
生きて帰すわけにはいかんのだ

1697
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,110
Why? Why do you hide the Blue Dragon?

1698
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,110
なぜ なぜ彼を 青龍の事を隠そうとするの

1699
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,600
確かにここは我らの里と真逆なのかもしれません

1700
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,610
Perhaps this place really is the opposite of my village.

1701
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,180
尊き龍の力を呪いなどと

1702
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,820
They called the noble dragon's power a curse.

1703
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,870
Quiet!

1704
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,070
だまれ

1705
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,950
Don't fight in this narrow space!

1706
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,940
止してよ こんな狭い所で

1707
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,110
キジャ

1708
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,750
Ki-ja!

1709
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,910
ご安心を 素人相手に力は使っていません

1710
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,880
Don't worry. I won't use
my power against amateurs!

1711
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,260
You only punched him with tens of times the strength of most men.

1712
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,450
常人の何十倍の力で拳骨しとるがな

1713
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,730
お願い 教えて

1714
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,880
Please tell me.

1715
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,820
どうして青龍が疎まなければならないの

1716
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,930
Why does the Blue Dragon have to be shunned?

1717
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,310
呪いって 一体なんなの

1718
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,260
What is this curse?

1719
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,220
Quiet!

1720
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,440
黙れ

1721
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,290
地震

1722
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,060
An earthquake?!

1723
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,640
Run!

1724
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,710
逃げろ

1725
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,440
Princess!

1726
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,930
姫様

1727
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,130
ハク

1728
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,900
Hak!

1729
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,400
An earthquake?

1730
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,490
地震

1731
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,280
Help!

1732
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,400
助けて

1733
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,080
Princess!

1734
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,090
姫さん

1735
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,500
The princess and the others are in there.

1736
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,570
おの奥には 姫さん達が

1737
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,150
クソ

1738
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,250
Damn it!

1739
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,650
You can't be serious.

1740
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,720
嘘...だろ

1741
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,710
姫さん

1742
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,610
Princess...

1743
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,070
Princess!

1744
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,380
姫さん

1745
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,370
Yun! White Snake!

1746
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,560
ユン 白蛇

1747
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,500
I'll be careful not to let anything
like that happen again.

1748
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,380
さっき見たいな事にならない様に気をづけるから

1749
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,880
I shouldn't have let her go.

1750
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,310
行かせるんじゃなかった

1751
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,640
こう言う事態をどうして予測出来ない

1752
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,300
Why didn't I anticipate this?

1753
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,620
こんな所で 守れねぇって

1754
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,430
I can't believe I failed to protect her here.

1755
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,490
頼む イル陛下

1756
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,220
Please, King Il...

1757
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,220
Don't take her from me.

1758
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,320
連れていかないでくれ

1759
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,330
ハク

1760
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,230
Hak...

1761
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,470
怖いよ 本当はすごく

1762
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,530
I'm actually really scared.

1763
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,610
I wanted to do my best without you...

1764
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,730
ハクが居なくても頑張ろうって思ったのに

1765
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,640
怖くて ついハクを探してしまう

1766
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,910
but I end up looking to you out of fear.

1767
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,370
I'm so weak.

1768
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,470
私はこんなにも弱い

1769
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,750
I don't want to fail, but I...

1770
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,670
負けたくないのに

1771
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,790
Princess... Princess...

1772
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,860
姫様 姫様

1773
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,690
姫様

1774
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,500
Princess!

1775
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,730
キジャ

1776
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,510
Ki-ja?

1777
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,550
大丈夫ですか

1778
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,340
Are you all right?

1779
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,400
あれ どうなったの

1780
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,180
Huh? What happened?

1781
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,000
地震は収まったのですが

1782
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,970
The earthquake subsided, but...

1783
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,180
It's no use!

1784
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,490
ダメだ

1785
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,270
出口が塞がれてる

1786
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,060
The exit is blocked!

1787
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
No...

1788
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,130
そんな

1789
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,940
You can't be serious!

1790
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,220
嘘だろう

1791
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,810
Are we going to die?

1792
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,470
俺等死ぬのか

1793
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,230
We can't get out?

1794
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,490
出られない

1795
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,190
You must be joking!

1796
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,220
冗談じゃない

1797
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,610
We're trapped.

1798
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,620
閉じ込められた

1799
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,360
Yun?

1800
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,670
ユン

1801
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,740
We won't be able to breathe
for long in this small space.

1802
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,870
こんな狭い所で息が続かないよ

1803
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,700
I don't want to die! Help me!

1804
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,750
死にたくない 助けてくれ

1805
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,830
No. At this rate...

1806
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,930
そんな このままじゃ

1807
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm scared, Hak.

1808
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,420
怖い...ハク

1809
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,900
だからなぜ其方に言われねばならんのだ

1810
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,130
I don't need you to tell me that!

1811
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,710
キジャ

1812
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,840
Ki-ja?

1813
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,090
Oh, forgive me.

1814
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,260
申し訳ありません

1815
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,590
For some reason, that rude man suddenly...

1816
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,530
今なぜ唐突にあの無礼な男が頼むと頭の中で喋ったので

1817
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,380
I'm counting on you.

1818
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,390
...just spoke inside my head.

1819
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,850
It made me very angry.

1820
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,200
なんだかとてもむかむかしてしまい

1821
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,000
姫様をお守りするのは私のお役目なのに

1822
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,850
It's my job to protect you, Princess.

1823
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,200
何か元気出てきたわ

1824
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,190
I'm feeling better.

1825
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,610
So am I!

1826
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,710
私も元気です

1827
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,980
大丈夫 ユン

1828
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,070
It's okay, Yun.

1829
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,690
必ず助けがきてくれる

1830
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,820
Help will come for us.

1831
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,100
待ってろ 姫さん

1832
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,030
You just wait, Princess.

1833
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,330
I'll...

1834
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,710
必ず

1835
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,750
We don't need to wait for help.

1836
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,820
助けなど待ったずとも

1837
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,930
この私が居る限り 案ずる事は何もございません

1838
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,920
As long as you have me, you've nothing to fear.

1839
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,800
K-Ki-ja, what are you going
to do with those claws?

1840
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,870
キ キジャ どうすんのさ 爪なんか出して

1841
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,510
Dig!

1842
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,910
掘る

1843
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,680
Monster!

1844
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,200
化け物

1845
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
騒がしいぞ

1846
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,640
Don't be so noisy.

1847
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,510
青龍の里を守る者達が情けない

1848
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,480
The guardians of the Blue Dragon's
village are pathetic.

1849
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,100
I told you that I am the White Dragon.

1850
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,170
私は白龍だと言ったであろう

1851
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,900
Th-The White Dragon!

1852
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,970
は 白龍

1853
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,820
There really are other dragons
that possess cursed powers!

1854
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,490
本当にいたのか

1855
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,910
青龍様以外にも呪いの力を持った龍が

1856
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,110
I've had enough!

1857
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,420
もう嫌だ

1858
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,200
It's him. It's his fault.

1859
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,130
彼奴が 彼奴のせいだ

1860
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,770
彼奴が居るから 俺達はこんな

1861
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,700
We're stuck in this hole because of him.

1862
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,830
Let me out! Let me out!

1863
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,180
出して 出してくれ

1864
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,960
Why? Why is the Blue Dragon's power a curse?

1865
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,940
どうして どうして青龍の力が呪いなの

1866
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,770
あんなに あんなに優しい手をしてるのに

1867
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,880
But... But his hands are so gentle.

1868
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,130
知らぬのだ 奴の邪悪さを

1869
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,050
You don't know how evil he can be.

1870
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,590
He isn't evil-

1871
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,830
彼は邪悪じゃ...

1872
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,010
Outsiders wouldn't understand!

1873
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,620
余所者に何が分かる

1874
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,670
ずっと 一族の中から龍の目を持つ化け物が生まれ

1875
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,900
For generations, monsters with the dragon's eyes have been born in our village.

1876
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,820
青龍の力に怯えて暮らし

1877
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,190
We live in fear of the Blue Dragon's power.

1878
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,280
Even if the Blue Dragon dies, someone else's child becomes the new Blue Dragon.

1879
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,880
青龍が死んでもまた誰かの子供が青龍になって

1880
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,220
次は我が子かもしれないと

1881
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,370
You don't know how it feels to live in fear
that your own child will be next!

1882
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,490
死ぬまで怯えて生きる気持ちが

1883
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,840
我々はそんな呪いを抱えていると
決して外に広めてはならないのだ

1884
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:36,000
Those of us who bear that curse
must never leave the village.

1885
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,090
A mask is placed on the Blue Dragon
as soon as he's born,

1886
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,980
青龍は生まれてすぐ面をつけ

1887
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,000
あまり外にも出さない

1888
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,130
and we rarely let him outside.

1889
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,670
それが掟だ

1890
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,970
Those are our rules.

1891
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,060
But the Blue Dragon used his cursed power to kill many soldiers

1892
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,600
それなのに

1893
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,930
青龍はその恐ろしい呪い力を使い

1894
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,630
兵士を大勢殺したのだ

1895
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,610
まだほんの幼い頃に

1896
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,520
when he was only a child.

1897
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:01,130
それから我々は兵が来るのを恐れ
ここに移り住んだ

1898
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,230
We feared more soldiers would come,
so we moved here.

1899
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,110
I can't take it anymore!

1900
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,710
もう耐えられない

1901
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,910
これが呪いでなくて何だ

1902
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,820
What is this, if not a curse?!

1903
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,040
来た

1904
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,820
He's here.

1905
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,010
B-Blue Dragon...

1906
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,980
青龍...様

1907
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,840
俺は何も...

1908
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,220
I didn't tell the outsiders anything.

1909
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,510
余所者に話してなんか

1910
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,430
Stay back!

1911
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,010
寄るな

1912
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,000
呪いがどんなものが知らない

1913
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,030
I know nothing about his curse.

1914
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,740
But his eyes...

1915
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,780
しかし 彼は確かに

1916
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,140
息も止まる程の美しい目をしていた

1917
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,200
are breathtakingly beautiful.

1918
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,680
Do you see

1919
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,680
Do you see

1920
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,680

本当はもう分かっていたんだ
彼女を初めて見たあの時から

1968
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:35,180
In truth, I already knew from
the moment I first saw her.
