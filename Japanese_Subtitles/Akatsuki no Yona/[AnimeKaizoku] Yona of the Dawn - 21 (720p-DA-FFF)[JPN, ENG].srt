I see. You're all excellent.

288
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,160
阿波もまだまだ捨てたものではないな

289
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,290
Awa still has some value left in it.

290
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,880
クムジ様 どういうことですか

291
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,830
Lord Kum-ji, what is the meaning of this?

292
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,550
We came looking for work.

293
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,570
私達 仕事が頂けると聞いたここに

294
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,010
There is work.

295
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,080
仕事がある

296
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,130
Work so delightful that you
may not be able to handle it.

297
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,300
楽しい仕事がいやという程な

298
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,500
赤い髪か 確かに珍しい

299
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,220
Red hair? Unusual, indeed.

300
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,870
顔もなかなかの美形

301
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,890
Your face isn't bad, either.

302
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,750
売るのが少々惜しくなったわ

303
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,770
I almost regret having to sell you.

304
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,900
ヨナ

305
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,600
Yona!

306
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,360
With so many excellent goods,

307
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,660
これだけ上物が揃っていれば
一人くらい俺のものにしたところで そう損にもなるまい

308
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,700
keeping one for myself would be no great loss.

309
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,860
クムジ様

310
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,910
Lord Kum-ji!

311
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,430
そ そんな女より 私の方がきっとご満足いただけますわ

312
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,250
I-I'm sure I can satisfy you better than she can.

313
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,810
おぉっと 何を言ってるのかな 俺

314
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,750
Ugh! What am I saying?

315
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,040
Oh?

316
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,690
そんな女ほっといて どうか私をお側に

317
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,630
Forget about her. Choose me instead.

318
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,510
No, no. Who do you think you are?

319
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,300
いやいや 誰だお前 男だってばれたら 即殺されるって

320
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,220
Once he finds out you're a man, he'll kill you.

321
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,120
でも 約束したから

322
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,010
But I promised I'd protect Yona.

323
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
ヨナを守るって

324
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,370
お前もなかなかの上玉だ

325
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,140
You're quite beautiful, as well.

326
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
But...

327
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,900
Don't interrupt me while I'm having fun!

328
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,030
俺が楽しんでる時に 口を挟むんじゃない

329
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,830
クムジ様 商品に傷が

330
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,700
Lord Kum-ji, you'll damage the merchandise.

331
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,700
口を挟むなと言ったはずだ

332
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,660
What did I say about interrupting me?

333
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,280
いいぞ いいぞ

334
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,420
Good, good.

335
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,790
女は従順で黙って震えているのが一番だ

336
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,590
Nothing pleases me more than obedient women who tremble in silence.

337
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,590
この赤毛の女のようにな

338
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,840
Just like this redhead.

339
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,510
What?

340
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,630
なんだ

341
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,900
威圧感

342
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,600
Did she intimidate me?

343
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,230
こんな小娘に

344
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,940
This little girl?

345
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,010
いや 待ってよ

346
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,940
No, wait.

347
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,170
娘 お前は阿波の人間か

348
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,820
Girl, are you from Awa?

349
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,300
はい

350
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,990
Yes.

351
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:10,630
その昔 俺は一度だけ緋龍城にてお前と同じ赤い髪を見たことがある

352
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:10,620
Long ago, I once saw red hair
like yours at Hiryuu Castle.

353
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,810
一瞬だけ

354
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,880
For just a moment, in the distance,
I saw her hair reflecting the sun.

355
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,770
遠くから日の光に反射するその髪の女の名は

356
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,120
ヨナ姫

357
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,880
The girl was Princess Yona.

358
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,680
年の頃なら お前と同じくらいだ

359
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,470
She was around your age.

360
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,790
まさかお前 ヨナ姫か

361
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,430
Are you Princess Yona?

362
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,050
He noticed!

363
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,110
気づかれた

364
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,810
私は阿波の貧しい商人の娘

365
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,520
I'm the daughter of a poor Awa merchant.

366
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,680
ここで新しい仕事を頂けると聞いて参りました

367
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,770
I came because I heard you were offering work.

368
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,120
赤い髪のお姫様は存じ上げませんが

369
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,740
I don't know your red-headed princess,

370
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,370
クムジ様のお仕事で

371
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,450
but if being her would please you,

372
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,770
そのお姫様となった方がよろしければ

373
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,790
ヨナ姫と名乗らせていただきます

374
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,370
I will call myself "Princess Yona."

375
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,520
戯れが過ぎたか

376
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,630
I let myself go too far.

377
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,630
ヨナ姫がお前の様に

378
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,090
Unlike you, Princess Yona
would be too self-respecting

379
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,150
仕事欲しさから 床に頭を擦り付け

380
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,770
to rub her face on the ground and grovel before me for work, filthy wench!

381
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,500
俺のような者に抗弁を垂れる 自尊心なき者ではないわ

382
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,320
そうだ 何をバカなことを

383
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,400
That's right. How could I be so stupid?

384
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,970
第一 あの姫は 従者に連れ去られ 殺されたと聞く

385
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,110
I heard the princess was carried off
by attendants and killed.

386
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,990
イル王の庇護の元 飴のように甘やかに育てられた姫が

387
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,740
A daughter brought up under King Il's
protective pampering...

388
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,970
野生の獣のような目をするはずがない

389
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,780
wouldn't have the eyes of a wild beast.

390
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,190
ユン しっかり

391
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,790
Yun!

392
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,830
Hang in there!

393
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,800
もう か弱い美少女を蹴るなんて最低

394
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,840
Who kicks a cute, delicate little girl? What a jerk.

395
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,830
ユン

396
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,800
Yun...

397
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,550
Yona, your foot is turning blue.

398
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,460
ヨナこそ 足 青くなってるよ 痛いでしょう

399
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,430
It must hurt.

400
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,630
全然

401
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,560
I'm fine. I'd forgotten about the pain.

402
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,880
痛みなんて忘れてたわ

403
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,190
面白くなってきたじゃない

404
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,310
Things are starting to get interesting.

405
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,570
俺は痛みは忘れないよ

406
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,650
I'm not about to forget my pain.

407
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,170
百倍にして返ってしてやるからね

408
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,150
I'll pay him back a hundred times over.

409
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,650
What Lord Kum-ji said...

410
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,060
さっきのクムジ様のお話

411
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,780
Does he plan to sell us?

412
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,620
売るって 私達を

413
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,730
出して ここから出して

414
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,870
Let us out! Let us out of here!

415
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,220
ね 誰か

416
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,160
Someone...

417
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,370
Someone help! Somebody, please!

418
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,370
誰か助けて 誰か

419
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,290
There's no point.

420
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,340
無駄よ

421
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,900
私は二週間前からここに入れられてるの

422
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,380
I've been in here for two weeks.

423
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,170
泣いたって叫んだって 誰にも届かないわ

424
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,750
You can cry or scream,
but no one will hear you.

425
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,260
クムジ様にとって私等なんか
金儲けの道具でしかないの

426
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,880
Lord Kum-ji only sees us
as a source of money.

427
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,570
この町はずっとそいう所だったでしょう

428
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,010
This city has always been that way.

429
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,770
変えたいと思ったことはない

430
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,730
Have you ever wanted to change that?

431
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,300
なにを

432
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,940
Change what?

433
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,740
この町を...

434
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,610
This place.

435
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,680
この町からヤンクムジを退けて

436
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,740
Have you ever thought about
fighting Yan Kum-ji...

437
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,970
皆が自由に暮らせるように戦おうと思った事はない

438
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,740
and running him out of town
so you can all live here freely?

439
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,230
なに

440
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,490
What?

441
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,790
あんた本当にこの町の人間

442
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,870
Are you really from this town?

443
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,540
そんなこと言うのは

444
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,380
The only people who talk like that are outsiders and the strong.

445
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,060
外の人間と強い人間 後はよっぽとのバカよ

446
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,590
And idiots too.

447
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,680
特別強くもないけれど

448
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm not particularly strong,

449
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,230
この町を変えようよ命懸けで戦ってる人達を私は知ってる

450
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,180
but I know people who are risking their lives to change this town.

451
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,990
そんなバカを支えようとする
もっと頼れない女の子もいるけどね

452
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,730
And there's an even more powerless girl who's trying to support those idiots.

453
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,300
それ 誰のこと ユン

454
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,400
Who are you talking about, Yun?

455
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,660
なにを言ってるの

456
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,730
What are you talking about?

457
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,280
誰か助けに来てくれるっての

458
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,320
Is someone coming to rescue us?

459
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,390
そんなバカいないわよ

460
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,030
No one's that stupid.

461
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,120
それは分からない

462
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,240
I don't know about that.

463
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,740
でも 貴方達の言うバカが手を差し伸べたら

464
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,290
But if one of those idiots of yours
reaches out to save you,

465
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,320
信じて その手を握り返して

466
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,910
you should trust them and take their hand.

467
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,990
生きたいと思うのなら どうか

468
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
If you want to live, please...

469
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,660
死に物狂いで 生き抜いて

470
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,470
do everything you can to survive.

471
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,460
確かに私はなんの力もありません

472
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,060
I know that I have no strength to offer.

473
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,610
歯痒い程に 決して強くもありません

474
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,310
It irritates me how weak I am.

475
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,300
でも どうか守らせて

476
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,940
But let me protect them!

477
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,390
この国の姫として ただ一人の人間として 戦わせてください

478
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,860
As this kingdom's princess, and as any other human being, please let me fight.

479
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,390
Hak...

480
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,140
ハク

481
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,660
少しは休みなよ

482
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,680
Get some rest. You've been standing like that since yesterday.

483
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,740
昨日からずっと同じ姿で

484
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,100
This is how I sleep.

485
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,920
俺はこうやって寝る趣味だ

486
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,430
それにそのセリフは 白蛇に言ってやれ

487
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,400
Besides, you should tell that
to the White Snake.

488
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,500
兄ちゃん また夢見てんぞ

489
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,900
Damn you, Kum-ji!

490
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,610
Hey, you're dreaming again.

491
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,850
オノレ クムジ

492
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,580
許さんな

493
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,610
You'll pay for this!

494
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,170
なんだあれは

495
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,030
What's he doing?

496
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,780
Every time he nods off, he jumps up to pick a fight with the air.

497
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,920
時折うとうとしては飛び起きて空中に喧嘩を売ってるからな

498
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,620
Good grief.

499
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,970
綺麗な顔が台無しだね キジャ君は

500
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,120
Ki-ja's ruining his good looks.

501
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,440
緑龍 目の下 黒い

502
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,420
Green Dragon, you have dark rings under your eyes.

503
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,050
Don't sneak up on me like that, Sin-ha.

504
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,970
背後で呟かないでくれるかな シンア君

505
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,770
緑龍も 寝てない

506
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,590
You haven't slept either.

507
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,460
僕が まさか

508
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,590
Who, me? Don't be absurd.

509
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,170
僕はよく食べ よく眠ったし

510
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,720
I ate well and slept well.

511
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,810
夕べは女の子とも遊んで もう余裕余裕

512
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,430
I even had some fun with the ladies last night.

513
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,350
I'm the very image of composure.

514
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,980
Huh?

515
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,710
顔を見せろ

516
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,900
Let me see your face!

517
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,150
何するんだい ちょっと

518
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,980
What are you doing?

519
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,280
目を見せるのだ

520
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,980
Show me your eyes!

521
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,570
キジャ君 君の手 刺さる 刺さるから

522
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,690
Ki-ja, you're stabbing me with your hand!

523
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,610
こっち向け

524
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,650
Look this way!

525
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,660
I've been defiled,

526
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,740
汚された

527
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,320
but that hurt so good.

528
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,310
でもちょっと いた気持ちよかった

529
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,490
Dark Circles

530
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,490
Dark Circles

531
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:40,570
Dark Circles

532
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:40,570
Dark Circles

533
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,070
Dark Circles

534
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,070
Dark Circles

535
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,370
Keep your clothes on.

536
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,390
脱ぐな

537
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,450
You have dark rings under your eyes!

538
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,510
あったぞ 目の下にクマ

539
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,010
だから 昨日の夜は女の子と...

540
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,080
I told you. I had fun with the ladies last-

541
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,480
緑龍 昨日はずっと見張り台にいた

542
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,290
Green Dragon, you were in
the crow's nest all last night.

543
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,770
よく見てるね

544
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,750
You've been watching me pretty closely.

545
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,840
Come on, now. Do you love me that much?

546
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,170
やだな 僕って愛されてる

547
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,480
そなたもあの方が心配で 堪らないのだな

548
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,510
You're worried about her too, aren't you?

549
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,060
だからなに

550
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,180
So what if I am?

551
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,630
そりゃ僕はヨナちゃんが心配だよ

552
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,850
Of course I'm worried about Yona.

553
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,340
当然だろ ヨナちゃんは女の子だから

554
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,100
Who wouldn't be? She's a girl, after all.

555
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,880
なんでもよい

556
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,810
Whatever your reason,
as long as we feel the same way,

557
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,660
そなたが私と同じ気持ちならば

558
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,540
それだけで 背中を預けて戦えるのだから

559
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,440
I can trust you to watch my back in a fight.

560
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,900
勝手にしな

561
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,740
Do as you please.

562
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,170
でも あの子は心配しなくていいの

563
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,240
But shouldn't you be worried about him?

564
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,990
ほら よくしゃべる可愛い子

565
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,950
You know, the cute, talkative one.

566
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,370
Yun, right?

567
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,590
ユン君だっけ

568
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,720
あの子も力なさそうだし 危ないと思うけど

569
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,580
He seems pretty weak too.
He could be in danger.

570
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,520
あいつは大丈夫だ

571
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,710
He'll be fine.

572
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,830
うむ ユンは年若いのに敏く 努力家だ

573
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,960
That's right. For his age, Yun is very clever and hard-working.

574
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,650
私は時折 あの者に尊敬すら覚えるぞ

575
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,590
Sometimes, I'm even in awe of him.

576
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,230
シンア

577
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,730
Sin-ha.

578
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,320
港の船 動き出した

579
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,110
The ships in the harbor are moving.

580
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,610
お前達 そろそろだよ

581
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,370
It's time, boys.

582
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,340
今宵 我らが狙うとびっきりのお宝は

583
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,040
Tonight, our eyes are set on
the greatest treasure of all:

584
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,280
阿波の町の領主 ヤンクムジの首一つ

585
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,010
the head of Yan Kum-ji, Lord of Awa!

586
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,260
Yeah!

587
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,210
アオ

588
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,890
Ao.

589
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,100
おい 何を騒いで...

590
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,610
Hey! What's all the-

591
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,610
Huh?

592
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,010
おい 今騒いでた奴は

593
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,200
Hey, who was making all that racket?

594
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,330
Damned girl.

595
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,260
小娘

596
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,060
どうやって縄を解いた

597
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,460
How did you undo the ropes?

598
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,340
大人しく

599
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,250
Stay-

600
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,320
セーノ

601
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,000
Down!

602
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,700
し 死んだ

603
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,970
I-Is he dead?

604
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,140
いや

605
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,180
No. The anesthetic I rubbed on the needle just knocked him out.

606
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,500
最初に打った麻酔針が効いて 気絶しただけ

607
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,370
これで半日は起きない

608
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,310
He'll sleep for half a day.

609
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,210
あんた達 本当に逃げ出すつもり

610
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,940
Are you really trying to escape?

611
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,320
あんた 震えているの

612
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,400
Are you shaking?

613
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,390
足も 怪我してるじゃない

614
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,570
Your leg is injured, as well.

615
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,370
そんなんでよくあんな事できるわね

616
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,070
I'm impressed you pulled
that off in your condition.

617
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,080
Don't do this. We don't want to get involved.

618
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,630
止してよ 私達を巻き込まないで

619
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,060
私 貴方達を助けに来たの

620
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,830
I came to rescue you.

621
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,120
助ける

622
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,040
Rescue us?

623
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,570
この船の場所を仲間に教えるのが

624
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,170
Our job is to signal the ship's position to our allies.

625
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,430
私達の仕事

626
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,590
けど どうやって教えるの

627
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,390
But how?

628
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,120
船は港を出たし ここは海の上なのに

629
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,680
The ships have left the harbor. We're in the middle of the sea.

630
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,030
甲板に上がって花火を上げる

631
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,810
I'm going up on deck and launching a signal.

632
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,940
Huh?

633
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,400
It's a small firework,
but I'm sure our allies will notice.

634
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,660
小さい花火だけど 仲間がきっと見つけてくれる

635
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,140
仲間も海の上にいるの

636
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,860
They're out at sea too.

637
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,340
待ってて 必ず助けるから

638
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,070
Wait here. I promise we'll rescue you.

639
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,170
行こう

640
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,820
Let's go.

641
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,080
Okay.

642
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,940
変えたいと思ったことはない

643
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,010
Have you ever wanted to change that?

644
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,400
この町を

645
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,970
This place.

646
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,140
待って

647
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,550
Wait!

648
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,680
外は役人がうようよ居る

649
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,390
It's swarming with officials out there.

650
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,500
私も手伝うわ

651
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,270
I'll help.

652
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,140
Huh?

653
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,230
私の父さん船大工なの

654
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,900
My father builds ships.

655
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,260
船の作りには詳しいから 近道は案内できる

656
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,110
I know a lot about how boats are constructed. I can show you a shortcut.

657
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,970
ありがとう

658
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,820
Thank you!

659
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,650
But why?

660
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,810
でも どうして

661
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,700
さっき私達に言ったでしょう

662
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,740
You said so yourself.

663
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,590
助けが来たら信じてその手を握り返せって

664
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,200
When help arrives, we should
have faith and take their hand.

665
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,770
この町を変えたい

666
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,410
We too want to change...

667
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,430
私達も

668
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,080
this town.

669
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,300
私の名前はユリ

670
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,340
My name is Yuri.

671
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,720
私はヨ...えっと リナ

672
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,680
My name is Yo-

673
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,840
Uh, Rina.

674
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,830
おれあぁ...私はユン

675
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,050
I'm, uh...

676
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,060
I'm Yun. Try not to slow us down.

677
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,010
足を引っ張らないでよね

678
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,660
あんた生意気ね

679
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,930
You're sassy, aren't you?

680
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,020
It's started.

681
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,320
始まった

682
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,270
Yes.

683
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,410
クムジはどやつだ

684
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,160
Where is Kum-ji?

685
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,450
I'll kill him!

686
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,860
私が討取ってくれる

687
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,830
Don't pass out from all the excitement, White Snake.

688
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,890
燥ぎ過ぎて貧血起こすなよ 白蛇

689
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,040
I'm not a white snake!

690
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,390
白蛇ではない

691
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,830
シンア 姫さんは

692
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,920
Sin-ha, where's the princess?

693
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,070
まだ 見当たらない

694
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,090
I don't see her yet.

695
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,340
手加減しろよ 後で婆さんが怒る

696
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,050
Don't kill them. You'll be in trouble
with the old lady later.

697
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,730
婆さんなんて言ったら 船長に殺されるよ ハク

698
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,770
The captain would kill you
if she heard you call her that, Hak.

699
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,370
しかし 数多いな

700
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,310
There sure are a lot of them, though.

701
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,190
Kum-ji seems to have hired
a bunch of mercenaries.

702
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,520
クムジが傭兵を山ほど雇ったみたいだね

703
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,300
姫さん ユン とっとと出てこい

704
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,280
Princess, Yun, get out here already!

705
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,660
Damn it. There's no end to them.

706
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,920
クソ なんて数だ

707
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,840
クムジは今夜こそ 俺らを潰す腹なんだろうよ

708
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,870
Kum-ji means to destroy us tonight.

709
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Jae-ha?

710
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,210
ジェハ

711
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,170
You're already tired? But you're so young.

712
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,410
若いのに もうばてたの

713
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,540
I'm just getting started!

714
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,770
これからは見せ場だったんだよ

715
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,230
一晩中飛び回って 仲間助っ人する気かなぁ

716
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,130
Is he going to jump around all night,
helping people out?

717
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,390
Not even Jae-ha can keep that up.

718
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,810
いくらジェハでも体が持たないんじゃ

719
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,540
でも ジェハだから

720
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,390
But that's Jae-ha for you.

721
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,880
愈々海賊共と決戦か

722
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,850
Finally, it's time for our showdown with the pirates.

723
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,900
We hired all those mercenaries.

724
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,940
あれだけの傭兵がいるんだ

725
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,940
They won't reach this ship.

726
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,000
この船までは来ねぇんさ

727
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,830
楽な戦いだ

728
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,860
It'll be an easy battle.

729
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,590
女だ 女が脱走した

730
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,780
A woman! A woman escaped!

731
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,940
待って

732
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,870
Stop!

733
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,230
バカ目 行き止まりだ

734
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,160
Fool. That's a dead end.

735
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,500
Give yourself up!

736
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,560
観念しろ

737
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,010
ちょっとの間 眠ってておじさん

738
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,750
Time for you to take a nap, mister.

739
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,030
しまった

740
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,840
Crap!

741
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,230
動くな

742
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,840
Don't move!

743
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,260
Yuri!

744
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,480
ユリ

745
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,320
私達は大事な商品でしょう

746
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,310
Aren't we your precious goods?

747
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,600
If you hurt someone by swinging that around, Lord Kum-ji will-

748
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,720
そんなもの振り回して傷付けたらクムジ様が...

749
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,020
You're defective products that tried to escape!

750
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,460
お前等は脱走した不良品だ

751
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,990
阿波の人間が二度と逆らえないように見せしめに殺す

752
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,030
I'll make an example of you so the Awa citizens will never rebel again.

753
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,660
やめて ユリは関係ない

754
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,490
Stop! Yuri has nothing to do with this!

755
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,480
どうする

756
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
What should I do?

757
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,900
花火は俺が持っている

758
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,530
I have the firework.

759
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,340
急いで甲板に出て海賊に知らせて

760
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,000
I could rush onto the deck and signal the pirates.

761
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,330
No, that would endanger Yona and Yuri.

762
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,140
ダメだ それじゃヨナとユリが危ない

763
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,600
俺も甲板で捕まったら

764
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,540
If I got caught on deck...

765
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,630
This is terrible.

766
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,190
最悪だ

767
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,970
こんなところで花火も上げられず

768
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,300
We're stuck here, unable to launch the signal.

769
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,210
どうする どうする

770
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,760
What should I do? What should I do?

771
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,950
どうする

772
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,890
What should I do?

773
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,900
昔の俺だったら 自分の命を最優先に考えた

774
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,650
The old me would have prioritized my own life.

775
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,060
自分が逃げ切る一番効率のいい方法を考えた

776
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,900
I would have thought of the most
effective way for me to escape.

777
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,740
でも 今は...

778
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,360
But now...

779
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,460
イクス 俺 バカになったのかも

780
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,200
I think I might have become an idiot, Ik-su.

781
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,040
I think I might have become an idiot, Ik-su.

782
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:32,080
ヨナの勇気を無駄になんてさせない

783
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,000
Yona's courage...

784
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,750
I won't let her courage go to waste.

785
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,630
Huh?

786
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,170
I threatened them into helping me.

787
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,080
この二人は俺に落とされて協力しただけだよ

788
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,540
本当に無関係だから 許してやって

789
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,180
They have nothing to do with this, so let them go.

790
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,300
A man?

791
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,810
男

792
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,930
I'm actually a pirate.

793
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:45,990
俺は実は海賊でこの船に密偵として入り込んでたんだよね

794
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,720
I stowed away on this ship as a spy.

795
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,270
A pirate?

796
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,330
海賊だと

797
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,350
Damn you!

798
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,660
この野郎

799
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,360
Don't think we'll show any mercy, pirate!

800
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,300
海賊なら尚更容赦しねぇ

801
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,320
ふざけやって

802
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,230
How dare you mock us?

803
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,230
I'll beat you to death!

804
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,790
殴り殺してやる

805
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,060
やめて

806
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
Stop!

807
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,610
ちょっと待った 話があるんだよ

808
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,570
Wait. I have something to tell you.

809
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,330
I've rigged the deck with explosives.

810
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:08,680
俺さ この船の甲板に爆薬仕掛けたんだよね

811
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,540
Rigged the deck with explosives?

812
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,810
甲板に爆薬だと

813
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,990
止めないと もうすぐ爆発するよ

814
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,040
If I don't stop them, they'll explode soon.

815
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,190
嘘をつけ 甲板にそんなものなかった

816
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,260
Liar! There wasn't anything like that on deck.

817
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,140
そりゃそうだろ 場所は俺しか知らねぇもん

818
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,800
Of course not. Only I know where they are.

819
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,190
黙って殺されるものか

820
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,260
I'm not going down without a fight.

821
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,610
とにかく甲板に出れば
シンアに見つけてもらえば なんとかなる

822
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,430
If I can get on deck and Sin-ha sees us,
we can still pull this off.

823
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,020
What should we do?

824
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,340
どうする

825
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,010
クソ

826
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,650
Damn it!

827
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,920
お前はその女達を下に連れ戻せ

828
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,070
You take the women back down.

829
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,540
俺はこいつを甲板に連れていく

830
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,690
I'll take this guy to the deck.

831
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,320
And?

832
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:46,450
Explosives or not, I'll cut off his head before returning him to the pirates.

833
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,770
爆薬があってもなくても

834
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,720
こいつの首を刎ねて海賊共に返してやるのさ

835
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,860
来い

836
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,830
Come!

837
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,500
Yun!

838
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,920
ユン

839
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,580
Hey, behave yourself!

840
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,630
大人しくしろ

841
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,130
Come on, get moving!

842
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,210
ほら 早く行け

843
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,560
どこへ行く お前は下...

844
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,590
Where are you going?
I'm taking you down to-

845
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,700
こ 此奴...

846
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,470
Y-You little...

847
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,060
What?

848
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,100
Wait!

849
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,480
待って

850
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,480
どこだ どこに仕掛けた

851
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,980
Where? Where are they?

852
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,240
There's nothing here!

853
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
どこにもねぇじゃねか

854
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,810
だから こっちじゃなくてもっと先だよ

855
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,280
They aren't over here.

856
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,530
They're farther down, near the bow.

857
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,370
チクショウ ここからじゃ死角で見えない

858
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,460
Damn it. We're in a blind spot.

859
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,100
もっと空が開けたところじゃなきゃ

860
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,920
I need to get somewhere more open.

861
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,880
やっぱり嘘か

862
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,920
I knew you were lying.

863
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,500
首を落として仲間のところに返してやるよ 海賊

864
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,300
I'll cut off your head and send you back to your buddies, pirate.

865
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,430
ヨナ

866
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,440
Yona?

867
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,720
ユンから離れなさい

868
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,650
Get away from Yun.

869
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,900
近づいたものは 打つ

870
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,690
I'll shoot anyone who approaches him.

871
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,060
なんだ さっきの小娘か

872
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,110
Oh, it's the girl from before.

873
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,370
そんなヘロヘロ矢で 何をするって

874
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,870
How are you going to shoot anyone with-

875
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,580
Yona!

876
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,190
ヨナ

877
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,340
Light the gunpowder quickly with that flame!

878
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,740
俺の爆薬を早くあの火に

879
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,190
ユン 火薬は

880
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,340
Yun, do you have the gunpowder?

881
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,100
帯の中に仕込んでる

882
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,930
It's inside my sash.

883
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,600
Get her!

884
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,430
捕まえろ

885
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,830
上がれ

886
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,270
Launch!

887
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,770
Launch!

888
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,570
よかった

889
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,400
It launched!

890
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:24,230
Crying tears for the days that won't return

00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:24,230
