2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,070
I have a favor to ask of you two.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,910
お二人にお願いがあるのです

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,030
I want you to take Yun with you on your journey.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,900
ユン君も旅に連れて行って欲しい

00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,840
Episode 8:   The Chosen Door

7
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,840
Episode 8:   The Chosen Door

8
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,890
Yun, did you make these clothes?

9
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,310
この服ユンが作ったの

10
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,680
Not really. I just had some leftover cloth.

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,190
別に 布が余ってたから

12
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,020
As a princess, you probably want
nothing less than silk,

13
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,510
絹じゃないから お姫様は不満だろうけど

14
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,460
前のボロより増しだろう

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,020
but it's better than those rags you had on.

16
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,990
面白い服 気に入った

17
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,360
I love these interesting clothes!

18
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,970
面白い服

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,520
Interesting clothes?

20
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,690
Hey, lend me something sharp.

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,580
ね 何か切る道具 貸して

22
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,310
髪 揃える

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm going to even out my hair.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,240
With that?!

25
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,680
それで

26
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,590
ったく 面倒くさい

27
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,120
Jeez, what a pain.

28
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,440
これだからお姫様は...

29
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,410
This is why I hate princesses.

30
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,660
You can do anything, can't you, Yun?

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,620
ユンって何でも出来るのね

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,310
手のかかる神官が居るからね

33
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,330
Because I have that troublesome
priest to take care of.

34
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,240
彼奴がけがばかりするから 医術覚えたし

35
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,170
I learned medicine because
he constantly hurts himself,

36
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,880
and I've mastered cooking.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,820
料理も完璧

38
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,770
欠点と言えば 美少年過ぎるくらいだね

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,760
My only flaw is that I'm far too handsome.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,130
I didn't ask about that.

41
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,240
それは聞いてない

42
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,080
でも 優しいね

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,100
You're kind, though.

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,720
Huh?

45
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,130
イクスの事もだけど

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,140
You're kind to Ik-su too.

47
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,400
王族が嫌いだって言ったのに 私の髪 切ってくれてる

48
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,400
But you're cutting my hair,
even though you said you hated royalty.

49
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,980
Just so you know, this isn't free.

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,150
有料だよ 言っとくけど

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,650
You owe me for the medicine,
clothes, and the haircut.

52
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,950
治療代とか服代とか散髪も

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,880
えっと

54
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,990
Um...

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,590
ムンドクに付けといて

56
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,700
Bill it to Mun-deok!

57
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,660
ムンドク 風の部族の英雄じゃん

58
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,160
Mun-deok?! He's the Wind Tribe's hero!

59
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,620
Mun-deok's a hero?

60
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,620
ムンドクって英雄なの

61
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,190
バカ ムンドクって言ったら

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,420
Idiot! Mun-deok was a powerful commander,
just as strong as Yu-hon.

63
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,970
あのユホンと並び称される最強の武将だったんだから

64
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,630
He was? The Mun-deok I know is an
old man who loves his children.

65
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,740
そうなんだ 私の知ってるムンドクは
子供思いのお爺さんだから

66
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,340
Jeez.

67
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,140
まったく

68
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,660
終わったよ

69
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,430
I'm finished.

70
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,150
ありがとう

71
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,800
Thank you.

72
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,590
ユンって何でも知ってるよね

73
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,560
You know everything, Yun.

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,430
I can't help it. I'm a genius.

75
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,710
天才だから仕方ない

76
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,510
本は一回読めば暗記できるし

77
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,310
I can memorize books after reading them once.

78
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,390
That's amazing.

79
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,500
凄い

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,530
でも俺が読んだのは一部の本だけ

81
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,900
But I've only read a few books.

82
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,950
世界には俺が知らない本がたくさんある

83
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,110
There are tons of books I'm not
familiar with in the world.

84
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,260
むかつく

85
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,900
It makes me angry.

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,680
読んでみたい

87
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,160
Would you like to read them?

88
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,830
そりゃね

89
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,160
Of course.

90
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,300
あのね ユン

91
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,160
Listen, Yun.

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,790
It's not a problem, though.

93
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,620
ま でも問題ないよ

94
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,060
本は少しつつ集めるし

95
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,210
I can collect books bit by bit.

96
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,530
俺は当分 この汚い本でいいや

97
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,420
And I'll be satisfied with this filthy book for a while.

98
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,250
Which one is it?

99
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,190
その本は

100
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,970
イクスのバカが私の為につってゴミから漁ってきたり

101
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,800
That idiot Ik-su dug it out of the garbage for me,

102
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,130
何もない所で転んで破ったり

103
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,090
then tore it when he tripped over nothing.

104
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,150
恐れべきドジね

105
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,010
He's incredibly clumsy.

106
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,180
He's stupid, isn't he?

107
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,930
間抜けだろ

108
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,190
All his "God" business might seem phony,

109
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,770
神だ何だって胡散臭いけど

110
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,480
but I know better than anyone that he can't...

111
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:18,150
彼奴が嘘付けない奴だってのは俺が一番知ってる...し

112
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,940
lie.

113
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,200
と とにかく 旅に出るならとっとと行っちゃてよね

114
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,610
I-In any case, if you're leaving
on a journey, get out of here.

115
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,700
I don't have time to look after you two.

116
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,310
俺 あんたらの面倒を見る暇ないし

117
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,260
イクス

118
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,210
Ik-su.

119
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,020
姫様

120
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,130
Princess.

121
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,340
Those clothes are beautiful.

122
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,100
その服 素敵です

123
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,050
You look great in them.

124
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,170
とてもお似合いです

125
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,110
ユン君ですね

126
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,390
Yun made them, didn't he?

127
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,220
He's an incredible boy.

128
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,590
あの子は本当にすごい

129
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,310
Yes.

130
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,640
それでどうでしたかユン君は

131
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,640
Anyway, what did Yun say?

132
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,130
イクスって 私の父上に似てる

133
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,070
Ik-su, you're a lot like my father.

134
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,280
Huh? You mean King Il?

135
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,480
え イル陛下ですか

136
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,110
Yes.

137
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,420
そんな 恐れ多い

138
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,990
You're too generous.

139
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,310
頼りなくて泣き虫で頭に花咲がいてて

140
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,740
You're unreliable, a crybaby,
and your head is in the clouds.

141
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,440
でも 可愛い人

142
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,200
But you're a cute person.

143
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,370
ね イクス

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,370
Hey, Ik-su...

145
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,250
Yes.

146
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,550
はい

147
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,880
Yun is foul-mouthed, but he loves you.

148
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,310
ユンは口は悪いけど 貴方の事が大好きだもの

149
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,410
私は家族を引き離したくない

150
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,300
I don't want to pull a family apart.

151
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,550
ユンを旅には連れていけないよ

152
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,260
I can't take Yun with us on our journey.

153
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,260
だから イクスのお願いは聞けない

154
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,810
So I can't comply with your request.

155
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,590
イクスのお願い

156
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,810
Ik-su's request?

157
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,460
イクスはユンを連れて行ってって言ったけど やっぱり私

158
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,480
You asked me to take Yun with us, but...

159
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,790
ユンが行くと言わない限り 連れて行けない

160
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,440
unless Yun says he wants to go,
I can't take him with us.

161
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,660
ですね

162
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,450
You're right.

163
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,240
ごめんなさい 僕が言うべきでした

164
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,370
I'm sorry. I should have been
the one to say that.

165
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,550
Ouch...

166
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,570
ユン君

167
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,550
Yun.

168
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,940
ちょうどよかった 今ね...

169
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,140
Good timing. I was just-

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,260
何 今の話 俺に何処行けって

171
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,390
What was that conversation about?
Where do you want me to go?

172
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,640
彼奴等と一緒に行けって

173
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,350
You want me to go with them?!

174
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,860
Yun, I want you to leave this place
and assist the princess and her friend.

175
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:27,220
ユン君 君はここを出て 姫達の手助けをしてあげて

176
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,880
何で俺が 冗談じゃないよ

177
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,870
Why me? You can't be serious!

178
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,460
君はこんな所に居ていい子じゃない

179
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,410
You shouldn't stay here.

180
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,370
世界を見て置いて

181
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,210
Go see the world.

182
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,080
イクス

183
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,170
Ik-su...

184
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,570

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,670
RAGE

1022
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,670
RAGE

1023
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,670
RAGE

1024
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,670
RAGE

1025
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,590
あの野郎

1026
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,680
That jerk.

1027
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,530
勝手な事言って

1028
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,810
How dare he say that?

1029
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,590
ユン君 これ見て 医学の本

1030
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,490
Yun, look. It's a book of medicine.

1031
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,950
Go see the world.

1032
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,060
世界を見て置いて

1033
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,290
Let me fry these fish.

1034
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,480
魚 焼かせろ

1035
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,310
もうそんなに動けるようになったの

1036
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,340
You can already move around that much?

1037
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,260
俺は不死身だ つっか死ねねぇ

1038
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm immortal. Actually, I can't afford to die.

1039
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,140
I have to look after a troublesome princess.

1040
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,620
世話の焼けるお姫さんが居るんだな

1041
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,820
なんで

1042
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,850
Why?

1043
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,510
自分の命を危険に晒してまで
お姫様を守る何て バカじゃないの

1044
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:43,400
You must be stupid to risk your
life protecting a princess.

1045
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,530
When you protect someone
you want to keep safe,

1046
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
おめぇは守りたい者を守る時

1047
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,540
いちいちてめぇの命と天秤にかけるのか

1048
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,650
do you always weigh your
own life against theirs?

1049
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,550
魚 食う

1050
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,420
Want some fish?

1051
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,240
要らない

1052
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No.

1053
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,930
チクショウ

1054
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,770
Damn it.

1055
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,290
-Seven Years Earlier-
Fire Tribe Region, Toka Village

1056
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,290
-Seven Years Earlier-
Fire Tribe Region, Toka Village

1057
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,790
Someone help!

1058
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,630
Yesterday, I ate tree roots.

1059
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,740
昨日 口にしたのは木の根っこ

1060
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,960
畑には作物どころか 虫さえいない

1061
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,800
The fields have no crops or even insects.

1062
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,430
Today, I'll steal food.

1063
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,380
今日は奪おう 食べ物を

1064
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,530
前やった時は 逆に殺されかけた

1065
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,020
Last time I did it, I nearly got killed.

1066
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,230
This time, I'll do it right.
I'll do it in one strike.

1067
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,170
今度はうまくやろう 一撃だ

1068
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,530
死んだっていいんだ

1069
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,280
I don't care if I die.

1070
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,460
よし

1071
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,410
All right.

1072
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,110
金 金 食い物

1073
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,790
Money. Money! Food!

1074
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,040
ごめん...何も...ない

1075
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,590
I'm sorry. I don't have anything.

1076
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,560
う 動くな

1077
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,480
D-Don't move!

1078
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,110
君は さっきの...

1079
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,730
You're that boy.

1080
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,440
Everyone in the village
has been talking about it.

1081
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,370
村で噂になってる

1082
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,190
最近 金の粒を持った余所者がうろついてるって

1083
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,660
Recently, there's been an outsider
wandering around with bits of gold.

1084
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,490
It's you, isn't it? Give them to me!

1085
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,040
あんただろ 出せ

1086
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,500
C-Crying won't help you!

1087
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,520
泣いても ダメだから

1088
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,620
ごめんね

1089
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,710
I'm sorry.

1090
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,080
金の粒はさっき別の子にあげてしまって

1091
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,710
I just gave some gold to another child.

1092
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,960
That was the last of it.

1093
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,060
それが最後だったんだ

1094
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,730
でも 今度なにが見つけたら
絶対君の所に持ってくるね

1095
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,390
But if I find something good again,
I'll definitely bring it to you.

1096
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,680
Huh?

1097
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,870
あれ

1098
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,030
あんたがボートしてるから悪いんだ

1099
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,060
It's your fault for spacing out.

1100
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,510
ここは食うか食われるか何だよ

1101
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,600
This is a dog-eat-dog world!

1102
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,410
大丈夫 痛くない

1103
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,400
It's all right. It doesn't hurt.

1104
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,900
Don't worry.

1105
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,910
心配しないで

1106
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,150
Why would I worry about you?

1107
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,280
心配なんかする訳ないだろ

1108
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,610
I almost killed you just now!

1109
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,810
あんた今 俺に殺されかけてんだよ

1110
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,240
Well, then, please excuse me.

1111
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,240
ではでは お邪魔しました

1112
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,590
話 聞いてる

1113
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,370
Are you even listening?

1114
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,960
H-Hold on! We aren't done discussing
those pieces of gold!

1115
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,990
ちょっと 金の粒の話はまだ終わってないよ

1116
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,920
You're staying with me today!

1117
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,770
今日はうちに居て貰うから

1118
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,260
I'm delighted. I'd actually planned
to camp out tonight.

1119
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,350
嬉しいな 実は野宿するつもりだったんで

1120
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,430
My name is Ik-su.

1121
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,660
僕 イクスと申します

1122
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,370
あったかい 生きてる

1123
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,270
He's warm. He's alive.

1124
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,910
これを塗って置けば

1125
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,650
If I rub this on...

1126
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,310
寒い 腹へった

1127
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,080
It's cold. I'm hungry.

1128
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,140
俺 ここで死ぬのかな

1129
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,130
Am I going to die here?

1130
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,710
芋だ

1131
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,550
A potato!

1132
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,440
あげる

1133
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,210
For you.

1134
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,470
Where did you get this?
Did you steal it?

1135
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,440
どうしたのこれ 盗んだ

1136
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,660
頂いた

1137
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,430
I received it.

1138
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,930
I haven't eaten a potato in so long.

1139
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,330
芋なんて久しぶり

1140
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,660
あんた どうしたの

1141
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,470
What happened to you?

1142
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,950
靴は

1143
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,770
Where are your shoes?

1144
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,660
芋と交換して貰っちゃった

1145
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,560
I traded them for a potato.

1146
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,990
交換して貰ったって

1147
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,810
You traded them?

1148
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,710
この寒いなか なにやってんの

1149
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,440
What are you doing?
It's cold out there.

1150
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,030
Why would you go so far for me?

1151
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,040
俺なんかにそこまでする

1152
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,410
Are you really up to something?

1153
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,640
なにか裏があるんじゃ

1154
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,150
だって

1155
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,990
I just...

1156
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,620
頭に薬を塗ってくれたお礼

1157
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,500
had to thank you for applying
medicine to my head.

1158
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,160
You were awake?

1159
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,260
起きてたのかよ

1160
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,370
Yeah, it's working well.

1161
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,480
うん よく聞いてる

1162
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,320
心がぽかぽかあったかくて

1163
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,840
My heart feels warm.

1164
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,610
なんだか 目頭まで熱くなっ...

1165
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,630
Even the corners of my eyes feel hot.

1166
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,120
なんで泣くの

1167
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,010
Why are you crying?

1168
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,130
変な奴

1169
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,340
You're weird.

1170
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,960
外の人間って 皆そうなの

1171
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,850
Are all outsiders like you?

1172
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
外にはいろんな人が居る

1173
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,220
There are all kinds of people outside.

1174
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,810
I don't go to the capital often, though.

1175
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,090
僕はあまり都には行かないけど

1176
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,350
都

1177
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,980
The capital?

1178
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,190
Do you want to go to the capital?

1179
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,260
都に行きたいの

1180
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,980
Yeah!

1181
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,390
早くここを出て 都や他の土地に行きたい

1182
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,400
I want to leave this place and go
to the capital and other regions.

1183
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,100
大きくなったら 本もいっぱい読んで
自由に勉強出来る所に行きたい

1184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Once I grow up, I want to go where I can
read lots of books and study freely.

1185
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,440
本 読めるんだ

1186
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,450
You can read?

1187
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,570
当然

1188
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,370
Of course.

1189
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
That's impressive.

1190
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,110
凄いね

1191
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,130
簡単な本ならだけど

1192
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,000
Just simple books, though.

1193
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,420
Someday, I'll learn to read difficult books.

1194
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,330
難しい本だって 何時か

1195
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,960
I'll find you a book, then.

1196
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,990
じゃ 今度は本を探してくるね

1197
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,920
I travel all over the place.

1198
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,370
色んなとこ 転々としてるから

1199
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,010
Huh? What kind of work do you do?

1200
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,060
え あんた何してる人

1201
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,060
神様に祈る人

1202
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,140
I'm someone who prays to God.

1203
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,230
神様

1204
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,260
To God?

1205
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,890
Yes.

1206
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,760
神様の声をたよりに 元気がない人訪ねて

1207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,770
The voice of God leads me to
people who are feeling down.

1208
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,720
その人が生きる勇気を手に入れるお手伝いするの

1209
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,770
I help those people find the courage to live.

1210
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,400
God doesn't exist.

1211
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,530
居る訳ないよ 神様なんか

1212
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,370
居る訳ないのに 嘘つきには見えない

1213
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,280
There's no way God exists,
but he doesn't seem like a liar.

1214
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,350
これからどっか行くのか 裸足で大丈夫

1215
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,250
Are you going somewhere now?
Will you be okay without shoes?

1216
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,750
I'll make some from straw. I'll be fine.

1217
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,990
草鞋作るから平気

1218
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,790
Straw?

1219
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,950
草鞋？

1220
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,500
I was taught how to do it long ago.

1221
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,990
昔教えて貰ったの

1222
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,750
T-Teach me!

1223
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,950
俺にも教えて

1224
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,770
ユン君 すごい

1225
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,760
Amazing, Yun.

1226
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,930
It's your first time making them,
but you could easily sell these.

1227
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,840
初めてなのに 売り物見たいな草鞋だね

1228
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,420
あんたのは草鞋に謝れってくらい酷いな

1229
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,010
Yours are so awful, you should
apologize to the straw.

1230
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,750
一つ覚えた

1231
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,560
I learned something!

1232
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,940
You can have these.

1233
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,040
これあげる

1234
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,110
Are you sure? These sandals are so nice.

1235
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,220
え いいの 立派な草鞋

1236
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,850
その代わり また何か教えて

1237
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,740
In exchange, teach me something else.

1238
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,060
だ 大丈夫

1239
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,340
A-Are you okay?

1240
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,540
I'm fine!

1241
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,680
大丈夫だ

1242
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,100
楽しかった もっともっと話したかった

1243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,090
That was fun. I wish I could
have talked to him more.

1244
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,840
聞きたい事 あったのに

1245
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,840
There are so many things I wanted to ask.

1246
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,520
I didn't really want him to go,
but I couldn't say it.

1247
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,400
本当は行かないでほしかったのに 言えなかった

1248
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,730
Next time... Next time we meet,
maybe I'll ask him...

1249
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,930
今度来たら 今度会えたら 言って見ようか

1250
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,440
ここに居てって

1251
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,230
to stay here.

1252
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,190
Maybe he'll think I'm a nuisance...

1253
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,390
面倒だと思われるかな

1254
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,200
But that's okay. Please come back soon.

1255
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,220
しれでもいい 早くきて

1256
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,080
どうしてくれる

1257
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,060
How will you make this up to me?

1258
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,390
一人なんていつもだったのに

1259
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,600
I was always alone before.

1260
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,310
But since I met you, I've been
so lonely, I can't stand it.

1261
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,330
あんたに会って 寂しくて仕方ないじゃないか

1262
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,450
Ik-su! What happened to you? You're hurt!

1263
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,620
イクス どうしたんだよそのけが

1264
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,620
You're so lightly dressed, too.

1265
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,970
それに そんな薄着

1266
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,950
ごめんね 来るのが遅くなって

1267
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm sorry it took me so long to come back here.

1268
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,590
Don't worry about that.

1269
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,460
そんな事

1270
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,310
たくさん色んなものあげたくて集めてたら

1271
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,130
I wanted to give you lots of things,
but as I was gathering them,

1272
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,800
some people who wanted my
gold took all my belongings.

1273
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,840
金の粒を狙う人達に持ち物取られて

1274
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,420
本もなくなっちゃった

1275
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,390
Even the books are gone.

1276
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,790
金の粒は もう一粒も残ってなかったんだけ

1277
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,980
I don't have a single piece of gold left.

1278
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,640
ユン君 僕 遠くへ行くよ

1279
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,570
Yun, I'm going far away.

1280
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,270
Huh?

1281
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,790
僕は人と居たいけど

1282
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,610
I want to be around people,
but when I have gold,

1283
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,730
金の粒を持ってた僕は人にとって良くないものを呼び寄せる

1284
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,370
it brings out something unpleasant in them.

1285
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,510
最後に顔が見たかった

1286
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,790
I wanted to see your face before I left.

1287
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,290
I really enjoyed making sandals with you.

1288
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,190
君と草鞋を作るのがとても楽しかったから

1289
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,590
さよなら

1290
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,380
Goodbye.

1291
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,590
行く

1292
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,260
I'll go.

1293
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,930
I'll go with you.

1294
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,040
俺も行く

1295
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,230
But I have to keep a low profile.

1296
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,330
でも僕はあまり表には出られなくて

1297
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,070
I can't go to the capital, and your books...

1298
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,090
都には行けないし 本だって...

1299
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,900
It's fine. I don't have to go to the capital.

1300
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,820
いい 都に行かなくてもいい

1301
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,590
本がなくてもいい

1302
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,570
I don't need books, either!

1303
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,280
You'll teach me!

1304
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,660
イクスが教えてよ

1305
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,080
だいたいあんたフラフラ危なっかしんだよ

1306
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,160
Besides, you're so clumsy!

1307
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,490
あんたに薬塗ってやれるのは俺くらいでしょう

1308
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,370
Who else would apply your medicine for you?

1309
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,060
外の世界...か

1310
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,500
The outside world, huh?

1311
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,650
な イクス 歴代の英雄の話聞かせて

1312
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,260
Hey, Ik-su. Tell me about
the heroes of the past.

1313
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,420
面倒くさい またけがしたのかよ

1314
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,010
What a pain. You injured yourself again?

1315
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,550
ちょっと待ってて 薬草を

1316
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,430
Wait here. I'll get some herbs.

1317
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,060
I know, but you're so clumsy.

1318
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,220
分かってるよ

1319
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,460
分かってるよ でも あんた危なっかしいじゃ

1320
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,080
ユン君

1321
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,860
Yun.

1322
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,990
これ

1323
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,030
Here.

1324
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,530
Your sandals are coming apart, aren't they?

1325
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,500
今の草鞋 もうぼろぼろでしょう

1326
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,270
相変わらず下手くそだな

1327
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
You're still as terrible at this as ever.

1328
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,620
Huh? I've gotten pretty good at making them.

1329
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,330
へ 大分上手に編めるようになってきたんだけど

1330
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,860
イクスは

1331
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,420
What about yours?

1332
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,830
Huh?

1333
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,220
イクスのだって ぼろぼろだろ

1334
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,090
Yours are coming apart, too.

1335
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,800
仕方ないな ちょっと待ってて

1336
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,840
You're hopeless. Give me a minute.

1337
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,530
凄いね ユン君は

1338
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,430
You're amazing, Yun.

1339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,660
本当にすごい

1340
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,390
Truly incredible.

1341
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,170
ほら

1342
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,890
Here.

1343
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,660
ありがとう

1344
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,440
Thank you.

1345
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,620
ぴったり

1346
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,820
They're perfect!

1347
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,650
Look, look!

1348
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,520
ね 見てみて

1349
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,330
転ばなかった

1350
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,200
I didn't fall.

1351
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,590
転ばなかったよ

1352
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,920
I didn't fall.

1353
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,790
僕なら大丈夫

1354
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,920
I'll be fine.

1355
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,750
イクス

1356
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,310
Ik-su, I know I called the princess naive,

1357
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,840
俺 あのお姫様に世間知らずとか言ったけど

1358
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,890
but she's actually just ignorant.

1359
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,950
実は知識だけで 現実はなんも分かってないんだ...たぶん

1360
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,980
She probably doesn't know anything about reality.

1361
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,420
それって 格好悪い

1362
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,360
It's so lame.

1363
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,220
ユン君

1364
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,150
Yun...

1365
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:05,410
Ik-su, I bet you don't know that,
to me, your words are absolute.

1366
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,880
な イクス 知らないだろ

1367
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,640
俺にとって あんたの言葉は絶対なんだよ

1368
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,870
So if you order me to go, I'll go.

1369
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,040
だから結局 あんたが行けと命じるなら俺は行くんだ

1370
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,600
それはきっと 俺の天命って奴でしょう

1371
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,710
It must be God's will for me, right?

1372
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,820
だいたいあんた もう俺が居なくても全然平気見たいだし

1373
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,510
Besides, you seem like you'll be
totally fine without me now!

1374
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,680
言葉には力があって

1375
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,520
There is strength in words.

1376
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,620
時にそれは 言霊になるんだ

1377
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,440
Sometimes, they become words of power.

1378
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:38,450
だから平気って言えば そりゃ誠となって平気になるかなと

1379
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,320
I thought that if I said I'm fine,
then I really would be fine.

1380
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,370
But it's no use. It doesn't work.

1381
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,480
でも...ダメ 効かない

1382
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,530
寂しくて...寂しくて...僕は

1383
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,410
I'm so sad. I...

1384
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,420
You're such a pain. It isn't the last
time we'll see each other.

1385
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,640
面倒くさい 今生の別れじゃあるまいし

1386
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
心は決まったのか

1387
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,940
Have you made up your mind?

1388
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah.

1389
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,620
ハクも賛成してくれるよね

1390
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,150
Hak, you approve, don't you?

1391
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,080
誰かさんよりは荷物にならなそうだしな

1392
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,650
He'll probably be less of a burden
than someone else I know.

1393
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,790
誰かさんって誰

1394
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,900
Who are you talking about?

1395
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,370
さぁな

1396
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,610
Who knows?

1397
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,330
ユン君 大丈夫

1398
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,910
Yun, will you be all right?

1399
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,670
それを聞きたいのはこっちだよ

1400
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,960
I could ask you the same thing.

1401
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,530
ユン なにそんなに持ってるの

1402
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,370
Yun, what's all that stuff you're bringing?

1403
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,880
If they're books, leave them.
It's just more bulk.

1404
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,930
本なら置いとけよ 嵩張るから

1405
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,170
They're not books.

1406
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,220
本じゃないよ

1407
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,590
What is it, then? Let me see.

1408
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,700
じゃなんだよ 見せてみろ

1409
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,400
これはお姫様を入れて警備されてる町中なんかに入る為の袋

1410
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,760
This is a bag we can put the princess in
when we enter cities that are guarded.

1411
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,110
私を入れる

1412
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,100
Put me in?

1413
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,360
他にも色々用意してるけど 見る

1414
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,480
I've got a bunch of other stuff.
Do you want to see it?

1415
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,190
もういい 行くぞ

1416
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,150
I've seen enough. Let's go.

1417
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,360
We'll lose the daylight.

1418
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,460
日が暮れちまう

1419
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,030
Huh?

1420
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,080
世話になったな

1421
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,070
Thanks for taking care of us.

1422
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,490
We'll see you later, Ik-su.

1423
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,330
イクス 行ってきます

1424
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,770
貴方達の無事を祈ります

1425
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,700
I'll pray for your safe journey.

1426
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,500
What the heck? You're the one
who told me to show you.

1427
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,040
なんだよ 見せろってそっちから言ってきたくせに

1428
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,280
いってらっしゃい

1429
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,380
See you later.

1430
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,040
Yeah.

1431
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,930
Let's hurry. Before the sun sets,
we need to cross three mountains.

1432
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,390
急ぐよ 日のあるうちに山を三つ越えないといけないからな

1433
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,430
Yes.

1434
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,930
Are you already ordering us around?

1435
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,350
いきなり仕切りますか

1436
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,480
天才美少年なんだから 当然でしょう

1437
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I'm a handsome genius. Of course I am.

1438
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,220
黙ってついてきて

1439
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,690
Shut up and follow me.

1440
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,400
Yeah, yeah.

1441
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720
Do you see

1442
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720
