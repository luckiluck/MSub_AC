00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,980
S-Su-won... Quickly, call a doctor!

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,960
ス スウォン 早く 医務官を

本字幕由✿花語&花丸字幕組✿共同製作

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,610
King Il will not wake again.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,500
イル陛下はもう目を開けません

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,110
I killed him.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,240
私が殺しました

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,990
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,010
何を言って

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Y-You're not the kind of person who would do this.

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,520
あ あなたはそんな事 出来る人じゃ...

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:32,010
You don't know how I have lived for this day.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,150
あなたは知らない 私がこの日の為に生きてきた事を

14
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,520
Episode 2:   Torn Bonds

15
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,520
Episode 2:   Torn Bonds

16
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,440
It's too quiet.

17
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,400
やけに静かだ

18
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,820
Then no one has noticed yet?

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,730
では また誰一人 気付いてないのだな

20
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,780
No, sir.

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,340
はい

22
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,830
賓客も文官達も皆 宴の酒に酔い
正体なく眠り込んでいます

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,910
The honored guests and civil officials are all drunk from the party and fast asleep.

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,240
I see.

25
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,930
そっか

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,040
Only General Hak's movements are cause for concern.

27
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,960
ハク将軍の動きのみが気掛かりですが

28
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,000
Who is cause for concern?

29
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,910
だれが気掛かりだって

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,050
Why don't you tell me in detail?

31
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,960
聞かせて貰おうか 詳しく

32
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,550
Wh-Why?

33
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,370
な なぜ

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,180
My father cared for you since you were a child.

35
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,100
父上はあなたを幼い頃からとても可愛がって

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,810
You're right.

37
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,570
そうですね

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,860
I loved King Il too.

39
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,740
私もイル陛下が大好きでしたよ

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,190
Even though people whispered that
he was a coward who feared conflict,

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,880
争いを恐れる臆病者だと囁かれてる

42
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,530
I used to believe he was just kind.

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,480
それが陛下の優しさなのだと以前は信じていました

44
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,790
However, I was wrong.

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,700
でもそうではなかった

46
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,620
That wasn't the case.

47
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,200
そうではなかったんです

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,130
Do you remember my father, Yu-hon?

49
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,010
私の父 ユホンを覚えていますか

50
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,460
My uncle?

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,140
伯父上

52
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,800
Ever since my father was young,
he was courageous and intelligent.

53
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,750
父上は幼少期より勇猛果敢で利発

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,970
He grew into a warrior
who always led our armies to victory.

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,880
成人して軍を率いれば常に勝利を収め

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,430
Everyone wanted him to become the next king,
and no one doubted that he would.

57
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,340
誰もが次期国王となる事を望み それを疑わなかった

58
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,890
However, ten years ago,

59
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,850
だが十年前

60
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,640
先王ジュナムがこの高華王國の王に選んだのは

61
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:38,230
the former king, Ju-nam, chose not my father, but Uncle Il, as King of Kouka.

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,250
父ユホンではなく伯父のイルでした

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,280
No one understood his choice.

64
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,150
皆理解出来なかった

65
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,620
The eldest son was the rightful successor to the throne,

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,300
王位継承権は長男にあるのに

67
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,240
so why did he choose the weak Il?

68
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,740
なぜ軟弱なイル様をお選びになられたと

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,960
But my father kept smiling.

70
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,440
しかし 父上はいつも笑っていました

71
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,710
The throne is no big deal to me.

72
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,740
王座など俺には些末事

73
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,880
俺は弟を守り民を守る為に前線で戦い続けようぞ

74
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,970
I will continue to fight on the front lines to protect my younger brother and my people.

75
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,760
I was proud of my father and respected him greatly.

76
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,050
私はそんな父上を誇り 深く敬愛した

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,440
Someday, I hoped to stand alongside him on the battlefield and offer my life to him.

78
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,360
何時か共に戦場に立ち
この命を父上の為に捧げようと思っていたのに

79
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,440
But after succeeding the throne,

80
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,270
王位に就いた後

81
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,990
for reasons unknown, King Il killed Yu-hon, his own brother.

82
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,910
ある御事かイル陛下は実の兄であるユホンを殺害したのです

83
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,240
No. My uncle died in an accident.

84
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,190
そんな 伯父上は事故で...

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,070
That's the official story.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,930
表向きはそうですね

87
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,330
But King Il stabbed my father
to death with a sword.

88
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,230
けれど父上はイル陛下に剣で刺されて亡くなった

89
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,370
Do you understand?

90
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,350
分かりますか

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,090
King Il, who was thought to hate weapons and avoid conflict,

92
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,010
武器を嫌い争いを避けていたはずのイル陛下が

93
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,050
killed my father with a sword.

94
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,970
父上を剣で殺したのです

95
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,550
No. It's not true.

96
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,470
嘘 そんなの 嘘

97
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,470
It is the truth.

98
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,630
それが真実です

99
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,100
I have avenged my father, and as his successor, in flesh and in spirit,

100
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,460
父上の敵を討ち

101
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:01,000
父上の遺志を受け継ぐ者として私はこの高華の王となる

102
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,480
I will become King of Kouka.

103
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,070
It's not true.

104
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,870
嘘

105
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,490
This is a dream, a nightmare.

106
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,420
これは夢 悪い夢よ

107
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,350
だってスウォン...

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,500
After all, Su-won,

109
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,500
you smiled so kindly...

110
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,730
あなたはあんなり優しく笑って

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,090
I love your hair, Yona.

112
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,970
私は好きですよ ヨナの髪

113
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,880
...when you gave me this hair ornament.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,740
簪を この簪をくれたじゃない

115
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,390
I wasn't expecting you to be awake in the middle of the night.

116
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,250
あなたがこんな真夜中に起きていたのは誤算でした

117
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,980
I had heard you hardly ever visited the king's quarters.

118
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,340
陛下の部屋にも滅多に立ち寄らないと聞いていたのに

119
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,520
Why did you come, Princess Yona?

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,180
なぜ来たのです ヨナ姫

121
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,520
I wanted to tell him...

122
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,230
伝えたくて

123
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:53,080
I wanted to tell my father
that I could never forget you.

124
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:52,890
私は...スウォンを忘れる事は出来ないと...父上に...伝えたくて

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,250
Lord Su-won.

126
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,170
スウォン様

127
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,210
Kei-suk.

128
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,130
ケイシュク

129
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,130
Everything is ready.

130
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,940
準備 全て整いました

131
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,930
You have achieved your long-cherished desire.

132
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,850
本懐を遂げられたのですね

133
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,810
Did Princess Yona see you?

134
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,720
まさか ヨナ姫に

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,060
This will make things quick.

136
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,090
ならば話は早い

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,820
Kill her, Lord Su-won.

138
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,910
殺してお仕舞いなさい スウォン様

139
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,820
Silence the princess.

140
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,390
姫の口を封じるのです

141
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,820
Su-won?

142
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,450
スウォン

143
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,960
Put it out! We don't want to draw any attention!

144
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,880
消せ 騒ぎ気取られてはまずい

145
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,630
Yes, sir!

146
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,800
捕まえてください

147
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,850
Seize her.

148
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,850
Yes, sir!

149
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,530
はい

150
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,100
Who... Who was that person?

151
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,020
誰 あの人は誰

152
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,190
That person who killed my father
and who is trying to kill me...

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,110
父上を殺し私を殺そうとするあの人は

154
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,190
is not Su-won!

155
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,030
スウォンじゃない

156
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,160
He is not my beloved Su-won!

157
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,920
私の大好きなスウォンじゃない

158
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,050
Prepare yourself, Princess.

159
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,590
お覚悟 姫様

160
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,390
This is for the Kingdom of Kouka.

161
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,530
これも高華国の為なのです

162
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,940
Did he hate me?

163
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,650
私は憎まれていたの

164
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,730
Since we were young, I...

165
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,440
幼い頃からずっと...

166
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,690
I only ever loved Su-won.

167
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,610
ずっとスウォンだけだったのに

168
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,200
I didn't ask for much.

169
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,200
多くを望んだ訳じゃない

170
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,120
As long as I could see Su-won's smile, I was happy.

171
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,010
スウォンの笑顔が見られれば それでよかったのに

172
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,370
スウォン

173
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,450
Su-won!

174
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,720
I knew Lord Su-won was here tonight,
so I was trying to stay out of your way.

175
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,340
今夜はスウォン様がいらっしゃいるから
邪魔者は遠慮したつもりだったんですがね

176
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,260
見張りだったはずの守備隊はここに勢揃いしてるし

177
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,350
The guards who were supposed to be on watch are all gathered here.

178
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,190
There are people I don't recognize too.

179
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,710
見知らぬ輩も嫌がりますし

180
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,520
What is the meaning of this?

181
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,320
これは一体どう言う事ですか

182
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,230
Well, Lord Su-won?

183
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,220
なぁ スウォン様

184
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,320
H-Hak?

185
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,190
ハ ハク

186
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,500
I'm sorry for leaving your side, Princess Yona.

187
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,340
お側を離れて申し訳ありません ヨナ姫様

188
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,540
Hak...

189
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,450
ハク

190
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,250
Hak, are you here for me?

191
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,250
ハクは私の見方

192
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,430
The king told me to protect you.

193
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,230
俺は陛下からあんたを守ると言われる

194
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,430
No matter what happens,

195
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,160
何があろうと俺は

196
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,560
I will obey his orders!

197
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,510
それに絶対服従する

198
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,510
控えよ下郎

199
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,810
Withdraw, servant.

200
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,530
You are standing before King Su-won, the new master of Hiryuu Castle.

201
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,450
今より緋龍城の主となったスウォン陛下の御前なるぞ

202
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,450
Who's the master of what, now?

203
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,340
誰が何の主だって

204
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,870
I have a bad feeling about this, but I must ask.

205
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,820
どうも嫌な予感がするんですがね

206
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,750
スウォン様 イル陛下はどこにおられる

207
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,830
Lord Su-won, where is King Il?

208
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,710
I just sent him to hell.

209
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,630
私が先程 地獄へ送って差し上げた

210
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,590
Are you drunk?

211
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,450
酒にでも酔っておいでか

212
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,260
That's going too far, even for a joke.

213
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,380
戯言にしては度が過ぎます

214
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,720
Ask Princess Yona.

215
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,800
ヨナ姫に聞いみるといい

216
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,230
She confirmed the king's death with her own eyes.

217
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,290
その目で王の死を確かめられたのだから

218
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,320
Tell the truth!

219
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,310
真実を言え

220
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,530
I'm not lying.

221
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,560
偽りではありません

222
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,530
Su-won! You are telling me
that you killed your king?

223
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,450
スウォン 国王を弑逆したと

224
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,160
You killed our kind king?!

225
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,500
お前が あの優しい王を

226
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,260
スウォン様

227
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,410
Lord Su-won...

228
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,720
下がっていなさい

229
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,080
Stay back.

230
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,790
If you get any closer, you'll lose your head.

231
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,710
近付けば首が飛びますよ

232
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,090
The man standing before you is Son Hak.

233
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,850
目の前に居るのはソンハクです

234
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,300
This man is...

235
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,020
この男が

236
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,050
Yes. He is the heart of Castle Hiryuu and one of the five generals:

237
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,970
そう 彼はこの緋龍城の要 五将軍の一人

238
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,680
the Thunder Beast of Kouka.

239
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,180
高華の雷獣

240
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Su-won, why? Are you trying to usurp the throne?

241
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,600
スウォン 何故だ 王位の簒奪か

242
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,360
No, you wouldn't fixate on that kind of thing.

243
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,230
いや お前はそんな物に執着する奴じゃないだろう

244
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,780
Did you turn your sword on our kind king,
who detested weapons?

245
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,700
武器を厭う心優しき王に刃を向けたのか

246
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,870
Your pride allowed that?!

247
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,780
テメエの誇りがそれを許したの

248
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,330
Kindness?

249
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,170
優しさか

250
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,710
This kingdom has no need for a weak king!

251
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,880
か弱き王など この国には必要ない

252
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,280
ソンハク

253
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,800
Son Hak...

254
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,930
He is grandson of Son Mun-deok, former head of the Wind Tribe.

255
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,970
風の部族の前族長 ソンムンドクの孫であり

256
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,430
He rose to lead the tribe at a young age.

257
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,340
若くして族長の座を就いた男

258
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,600
A single blow from his blade is like lightning,

259
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,550
その大刀での一撃は稲妻の様であり

260
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,270
高華の雷獣とも異名を持つ

261
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,320
earning him the nickname
"The Thunder Beast of Kouka."

262
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,170
That's enough!

263
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,020
そこまでだ

264
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,770
Lay down your weapon, Thunder Beast.

265
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,630
武器を抛け 雷獣

266
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,900
Lord Su-won, are you all right?

267
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,400
スウォン様 ご無事ですか

268
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,200
Su-won...

269
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,700
スウォン

270
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,740
Was the Su-won I knew just an illusion?

271
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,630
俺が見ていたスウォンは幻だったのか

272
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,290
I thought I could entrust you with the princess.

273
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,190
お前になら 姫を任せてもいいと思っていた

274
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,870
Fool.

275
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,660
愚かな 五将軍の一人と言えと 所詮はまだ若い

276
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,380
You may be one of the five generals,
but you are still young.

277
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,490
なに

278
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,460
What?

279
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,680
At this rate, the Kingdom of Kouka will fall into ruin before long.

280
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,730
高華王国はこのままでは時を迂闊 滅亡する

281
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,350
For you and Princess Yona, who have indulged in peace at Castle Hiryuu,

282
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,410
緋龍城で安念を貪ってきたあなたやヨナ姫に

283
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,010
there is no way to understand
Lord Su-won's feelings-

284
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,100
スウォン様のお心を推し量る事など...

285
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,560
Quiet, Kei-suk.

286
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,520
口を慎みなさい ケイシュク

287
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,020
What does that mean?

288
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,720
どう言う意味だ

289
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,320
The Su-won you know never existed.

290
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,780
貴方達の知っていたスウォンは最初から居なかったんです

291
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,990
Should anyone get in my way,
I will cut him down,

292
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,520
道を阻む者があれば切り捨てます

293
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,070
no matter who he is.

294
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,700
誰であろうと

295
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,160
I don't want to hear this.

296
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,610
聞きたくない

297
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,290
I don't want to hear any more of this.

298
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,940
もう 何も聞きたくないの

299
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,250
Wh-What?

300
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,050
After them! Don't let them escape!

301
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,040
護衛 逃がすな

302
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,800
Yes, sir!

303
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,650
はい

304
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,230
This way, General Hak!

305
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,350
こちらです ハク将軍

306
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,940
Did you take that terrible shot, Min-su?

307
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,180
お前か ミンス さっきの下手くその矢は

308
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,570
姫様を連れて付いてこい 離れるなよ

309
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,660
Take the princess and follow me.
Don't fall behind.

310
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,030
Y-Yes, sir.

311
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,770
はい

312
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,040
Out of the way!

313
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,340
退け

314
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,620
This way!

315
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,560
こちだ

316
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,130
はい

317
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,370
Yes, sir.

318
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,800
ハク将軍 後ろへ

319
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,710
General Hak, behind you!

320
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,720
We should find somewhere to hide.

321
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,640
一先ず 何処かに身を隠そう

322
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,930
You're right.

323
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,890
そうですね

324
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,930
Let's go.

325
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,840
行くぞ

326
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,720
Yes, sir.

327
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,540
はい

328
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,740
切りがないですね

329
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,860
There's no end to them.

330
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,500
Princess, is King Il really dead?

331
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,420
姫様...イル陛下は本当に亡くなられたのですか

332
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,800
I see.

333
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,640
そうですか

334
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,180
I'm sorry. I simply couldn't believe it.

335
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,090
申し訳ありません どうしても信じられなくて

336
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:35,140
Until just a while ago, he was smiling so happily about your birthday.

337
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,960
つい先程まで 姫様のお誕生日だと
幸せそうに笑っていらっしたのに

338
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,070
It's only a matter of time until they find us.

339
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,990
見つかるのも時間の問題だな

340
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,240
The soldiers that Lord Su-won brought here,

341
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,280
城内にはスウォン様が率いてきた兵と
スウォン様を支持する兵が集まりつつある

342
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,360
along with the guards loyal to him, are gathering within the castle.

343
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,660
If we're caught, they'll definitely kill us.

344
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,170
捉まれば間違いなく殺される...か

345
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,370
Yes.

346
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,290
はい

347
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,130
I'll secure an escape route for you.

348
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,920
私が逃げ道を確保します

349
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,710
You two must escape from the castle.

350
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,300
お二人はこの城から脱出して下さい

351
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,880
But you...

352
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,800
だがお前は

353
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,470
Don't worry about me.
I promise I'll get away.

354
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,340
ご心配なく 必ず逃げっ切って見せます

355
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,810
They're around here somewhere! Find them!

356
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,790
この辺りいるはずだ 探せ

357
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,650
Yes, sir!

358
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,440
はい

359
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,570
Six soldiers in front of the rear gate.

360
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,500
裏門の前に兵が六人

361
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,030
More waiting in ambush.

362
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,770
伏兵も...

363
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,870
Min-su, you...

364
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,230
ミンス お前

365
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,620
I'll draw them after me.

366
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,530
私が引き付けます

367
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,330
You use that opportunity to escape.

368
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,020
その隙に脱出を

369
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,880
Princess, take care.

370
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,330
姫様

371
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,770
どうか ご無事で

372
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,920
There she is!

373
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,880
居たぞ

374
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,730
あっちだ

375
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,550
She's over there!

376
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,550
Don't let her escape!

377
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,470
逃がすな

378
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,350
Min-su...

379
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,170
ミンス

380
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,520
姫さん 早く

381
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,690
Princess, hurry!

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,580
There she is! This way!

383
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,420
居たぞ こっちだ

384
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,260
Princess... King...

385
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,820
姫様...陛下...

386
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,530
They seem to have escaped into the mountains.

387
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,730
裏山の方に逃げた様です

388
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,530
I will organize a party to search the area immediately.

389
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,230
直ちに山狩り隊を組織致します

390
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,830
ハク将軍は峻険な山里 風牙の都の育ち

391
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,870
General Hak was raised in the precipitous mountain village of Capital Fuuga.

392
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,950
Even if he has the princess with him,

393
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,570
姫を連れているとは言え

394
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,540
it will be difficult for the men
of the castle to find them.

395
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,890
城の者達では発見は難しいでしょう

396
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,840
Princess Yona,

397
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,660
ヨナ姫

398
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,540
少し休みますか

399
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,930
should we rest a while?

400
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,270
Is Min-su dead?

401
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,110
ミンスは死んじゃったの

402
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,030
Am I also going to die?

403
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,880
私も死ぬのかな

404
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,200
Is Su-won going to kill you too?

405
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,120
ハクもスウォンに殺されて

406
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,650
あんなくそったれにやる命何て持ち合わせねでぇですよ

407
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,830
I don't have a life to give
to that piece of crap.

408
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,580
Please don't die, Hak.

409
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,480
死なないでね ハク

410
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,510
If you die, I won't forgive you.

411
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,420
死んだら...許さない...から

412
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,100
I still can't believe it.

413
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,020
まだ信じられねぇな

414
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,890
I can't believe King Il died...

415
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,780
イル陛下が死んだ何て

416
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,560
and left the princess alone.

417
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,170
姫を一人にして

418
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,570
You good-for-nothing king.

419
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,250
しょうもねぇ王様だよ

420
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,740
Su-won...

421
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,690
スウォン

422
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,700
I'm sorry.

423
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,620
申し訳ありません

424
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,170
I had them comb the mountains all night, but they still haven't found anything.

425
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,090
夜通し山狩りを行わせてはいるのですが 未だ

426
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,500
How are things inside the castle?

427
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,370
城内の様子は

428
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,260
People are beginning to notice something is wrong, and unrest is growing.

429
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,180
次第に異変を察知し騒ぎが広まりつつあります

430
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,050
General Ju-doh, what's going on?

431
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,900
ジュド将軍一体何か

432
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,800
Is this the work of insurgents?

433
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,510
賊の仕業なのか

434
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,680
We're investigating the matter as quickly as we can.

435
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,160
急ぎ調べを進めています

436
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,930
What should we do, Lord Su-won?

437
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,740
如何なさいますか スウォン様

438
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,740
Let's go, Princess. Our pursuers are coming.

439
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,680
行きましょう姫様  追手が来る

440
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,240
Where are we going?

441
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,160
どこへ 行くの

442
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:10,040
During the party, even though my father was crying tears of joy,

443
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,840
私 宴の時 父上が泣いて喜んでいたのに

444
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,210
I didn't utter a single word of thanks to him.

445
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,050
一言も言わなかったわ ありがとうって

446
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,890
Where am I supposed to go now,

447
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,810
なのに 父上を置いて どこへ

448
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,260
leaving my father behind?

449
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,110
どこへ行くと言うの

450
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,310
Hak...

451
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,150
ハク

452
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,110
We'll go anywhere we have to, as long as it means you'll live.

453
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,970
どこへでも行きますよ あんたが生き延びられるなら

454
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,660
That is how you can return the king's feelings.

455
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,440
それが陛下への思いの返し方です

456
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,880
My sixteenth birthday...

457
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,700
十六歳の誕生日

458
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,880
That night,

459
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,610
あの夜

460
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:04,680
I lost my family, my home,
and the people I loved.

461
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:04,250
私は家族を 帰る場所を 思い人を 沢山な事を失った

462
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,100
And then, I had the encounters
that led me to the present.

463
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,120
そして今に繋がる出会いがあった

464
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,410
What is that?

465
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,290
あれは？

466
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,450
Fire!

467
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,370
打て

468
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,710
何者だ

469
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,720
Who are you?

470
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,290
また新た敵

471
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,520
A new enemy!

472
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,460
大人しく去る この高華国から

473
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,330
Depart quietly...

474
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,580
from the Kingdom of Kouka!

475
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,800
この国を好きにはさせない

476
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,880
I won't let you run amok in this kingdom!

477
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,130
Damn you.

478
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,700
己

479
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,600
What?

480
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,520
なに

481
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,900
私は生きる

482
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,940
I will live...

483
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,630
亡き父上の思いに 仲間達に 報いる為に

484
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,740
to repay my late father's love
and my friends' kindness!

485
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720
Do you see

486
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720
Do you see

487
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720

488
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,720
wakaru kai

489
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:23,320
What I'm trying so hard to convey through my work?

490
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:23,320
What I'm trying so hard to convey through my work?

491
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:23,320

494
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:30,070
It's always been this way, hasn't it?

I hope you don't realize too early

511
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,850

遠い空

521
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,230
There's a reason why the snow is so cold

522
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,230
There's a reason why the snow is so cold

523
